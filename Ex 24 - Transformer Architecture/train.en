The Wanderer

THE BOARDER
He arrived at our home on a Sunday of November, 189-.
I still say 'our home,' although the house no longer belongs to us.
We left that part of the country nearly fifteen years ago and shall certainly never go back to it.
We were living in the building of the Higher Elementary Classes at Sainte-Agathe's School.
My father, whom I used to call M. Seurel as did other pupils, was head of the Middle School and also of the Higher Elementary classes where pupils worked for the preliminary teacher's examination.
My mother taught the infants.
At the extreme end of the small town, a long red house with five glass doors and a Virginia creeper upon its walls ; an immense courtyard with shelters, a washhouse and a huge gateway, on the side looking towards the village; on the north side, a small gate opening on the road leading to the station three kilometres off; on the south, at the back of the house, fields, gardens, meadows joining the outskirts...such is the simple plan of this dwelling where I spent the most troubled but the most happy days of my life - the house from which we launched our adventures and to which they returned to break themselves like waves on a bare rock.
At the time of some new 'appointments,' a whim of fate, due to some inspector or to the Prefect, had led us there.
Towards the end of the summer holidays, a long time ago, a peasant cart, preceding our household goods, deposited my mother and myself before the little rusty gate.
Urchins who were stealing peaches in the garden silently escaped through holes in the hedge . . . My mother, whom we used to call Millie and who was the most methodical housekeeper I ever knew, had at once gone into the rooms full of dusty straw, and had declared with much consternation - as was her custom at each 'removal' - that our furniture would never fit in a house so badly built. . .
She had come out to impart her trouble to me. While speaking she had, with her handkerchief, gently wiped my face blackened by the journey.
Then she had gone back to consider what doors and windows would have to be blocked to make the place habitable ... As for me, wearing a big straw hat with streamers, I was left alone on the gravel of that strange playground, waiting for her, prying shyly around the well and under the cart-shed.
Thus to-day I picture our arrival.
For as soon as I wish to bring back the distant memory of that first evening when I waited in out playground at Sainte-Agathe, at once it is another kind of waiting which I recall, at once I see myself again, both hands pressed to the bars of the front gate, anxiously watching for some one who will soon come down the High Street.
If I try to imagine that first night which I must have spent in my attic, amidst the lumber-rooms on the upper storey, I recall other nights; I am no longer alone in that room; a tall, restless, and friendly shadow moves along its walls and walks to and fro.
And that quiet countryside - the school, old Father Martin's field, with its three walnut trees, the garden daily invaded on the stroke of four by women paying calls - all this is, in my memory, forever stirred and transformed by the presence of him who upset all our youth and whose sudden flight even did not leave us in peace.
Yet we had already been ten years in that district when Meaulnes arrived.
I was fifteen.
It was a cold Sunday of November, the first day of autumn to make one think of winter.
All day Millie had waited for the station omnibus to bring her a hat for the bad weather.
That morning she missed Mass, and right up to the sermon, from my place in the choir with the other children, I looked anxiously towards the door to see her come to church wearing her new hat.
In the afternoon, I had to go to vespers alone.
'Anyhow,' she said to comfort me, brushing my little suit with her hand, 'even if it had come, this precious hat, I should have had to spend my Sunday making it up again.'
This is how our winter Sundays were often spent.
In the early morning Father went off to some misty pond to jack-fish from a boat, and Mother retired till nightfall into her dark bedroom, to remake her simple dresses.
She shut herself up in that way for fear some lady visitor, as poor as herself and as proud, might surprise her at the job.
As for me, vespers over, I waited, reading in the cold dining-room, until she opened the door to show me how she was getting on.
That Sunday, a little excitement in front of the church kept me out-of-doors after vespers.
A christening, under the porch, had attracted a crowd of urchins.
In the square a few villagers had put on their firemen's jackets and piled their arms ; stiff and stamping their feet with cold, they were listening to Boujardon, the corporal, losing himself in theory ...
The christening bells stopped suddenly, like festive chimes at a mistaken time and place. Boujardon and his men, rifles slung over their shoulders, dragged off the fire engine at a slow trot, and I saw them disappear at the first turning, followed by four silent urchins, crushing under their heavy boots the twigs on the frozen road, down which I dared not follow them.
In the village the only place left alive was the Café Daniel, from which I heard the murmurs of the drinkers' talk rise and fall, and hugging the low wall of the big playground which separated our house from the village, I came, rather anxious at being late, to the small gate.
It was ajar and I saw at once that something unusual was happening.
In fact, there stood, outside the dining-room door - the nearest of the five glass doors opening on the playground - a grey-headed woman, leaning forward and trying to look through the curtains.
She was small and wore a black old- fashioned velvet bonnet.
Her face was thin and refined, but worn with anxiety, and, at sight of her, I do not know what misgiving made me stand still on the first step, in front of the gate.
'My goodness, where's he gone!' she was muttering to herself.
'He was with me a moment ago.
He must have gone all round the house already.
Perhaps he's run away ...'
And after each sentence she gave three barely perceptible little taps on the window-pane.
No one came to let in the unknown visitor.
Without any doubt Millie had received her hat from the station, and, hearing nothing, at the end of the red bedroom, before a bed bestrewed with old ribbons and uncurled feathers, she was stitching, undoing, and remaking her modest headgear. In fact, as soon as I came into the dining-room, followed closely by the visitor, Mother appeared, both her hands to her head, holding wires, ribbons, and feathers which were not yet perfectly secured.
She smiled at me, from blue eyes tired with working till dusk, and exclaimed:
'Look!
I was waiting to show you , . .'
But noticing that woman sitting in the big armchair at the other end of the room, she stopped, disconcerted.
She quickly removed her hat, and during the whole scene that followed, held it against her breast, inside out, like a nest resting in the bend of her right arm.
The woman with the old-fashioned bonnet had begun to explain herself. She held between her knees an umbrella and a leather handbag, slightly nodding her head the while, and clicking her tongue as do village women when paying a call.
She had regained full assurance, and when she spoke of her son she even assumed a superior and mysterious manner which puzzled us.
They had both driven from La Ferté d'Angillon, fourteen kilometres from Sainte-Agathe.
Herself a widow - and very rich, as she gave us to understand - she had lost the younger of her two children, a boy called Antoine, who had suddenly died one evening, on returning from school, after bathing with his brother in a dirty pond.
She had decided to let Augustin, the elder boy, board with us, that he might take the Higher Course.
And forthwith she began to praise this boarder whom she was bringing us.
I could no longer recognise the grey-headed woman whom, only a minute ago, I had seen stooping in front of the door, with the piteous and haggard bearing of a hen who has lost the wildest chick in her brood.
What she was relating with admiration about her son was surprising enough; he loved doing things to please her, he had often gone along the river-bank for miles barelegged, to bring her wild ducks' and moor hens' eggs hidden amongst the reeds ... He could set nets . . . The other night, he had found a pheasant caught in a snare, in the wood ...
I, who hardly dared to enter the house if I had torn my overall, looked at Millie with astonishment.
But Mother was no longer listening.
She even motioned to the woman to be quiet; and putting down her 'nest' on the table with great care, she got up silently as if to take some one by surprise ...
Above us, indeed, in a box-room where the blackened remains of the last fourteenth of July fireworks were piled up, an unknown step trod confidently to and fro, shaking the ceiling, crossed the huge dark lumber-rooms of the upper storey and passed at last towards the unused assistant masters' rooms, where lime tree leaves were put to dry and apples to ripen.
'A little while ago,' said Millie in a low voice, 'I heard that noise in the rooms downstairs ; I thought it was you, François, come back ...'
No one answered.
We stood, the three of us, with beating hearts ; then the attic door which led to the kitchen was heard to open; some one came down, crossed the kitchen, and appeared in the dim entrance of the dining-room. 8
'Why! It is you, Augustin!' said the visitor.
He was a tall boy of seventeen, or thereabout.
At first, as night was falling, I saw only his peasant felt hat, pushed to the back of his head, and his black overall tightly belted in the fashion of schoolboys.
I could see, too, that he was smiling . . .
He saw me, and before any one had had time to demand an explanation:
'Aren't you coming into the playground?' he asked.
I hesitated for a moment.
Then, as Millie did not keep me back, I took up my cap and went towards him.
We left by the kitchen door and went into the yard under the shelter where darkness was already gathering.
In the dim evening light I watched, as I walked, his sharp-featured face with its straight nose and downy lip.
'Look,' said he, 'I found this in your box-rooms.
You couldn't have looked at these things.'
He was holding in his hand a little wheel of blackened wood; a string of partly burnt squibs was twisted round it; evidently a Catherine wheel from the fireworks display on the fourteenth of July.
'Two of them didn't go off. We will set them alight,' said he, in the tone of voice of one who hopes to make better finds later on.
He threw his hat to the ground, and I saw that his hair was cropped like a peasant's.
He showed me two squib lighters with their paper tapers which the flame had singed, before going out.
He stuck the axle of the wheel into the sand and - to my astonishment, as such things were strictly forbidden me - pulled out of his pocket a box of matches.
Bending down with care, he lighted the squib.
Then, taking hold of my hand, he quickly drew me back.
A moment, later, as she came out of the door with Meaulnes' mother after having discussed and settled the boarding fees, my mother saw two sheaves of red-and-white stars rising up under the shelter, hissing like bellows. For a moment's space she caught a glimpse of me as I stood in this magic light, holding by the hand the tall strange boy and showing no fear . ..
Once again, she dated not say anything.
And that evening, at dinner, there sat at our table a silent guest who ate with lowered head, paying no attention to the three pairs of eyes fixed upon him.
II
AFTER FOUR O'CLOCK
Then I had never loafed about in the streets with the other village boys.
An affection of the hip from which I had suffered up to this year of 189- had made me nervous and wretched.
I still see myself chasing the nimble schoolboys in the alleys round our home, hopping wretchedly on one leg . . .
So I was seldom allowed to go out, and I recall that Millie, who was very proud of me, more than once brought me home and boxed my ears for having been caught hopping thus with some village urchins.
The arrival of Augustin Meaulnes, at the very time of my cure, marked the beginning of a new life.
Before his coming, a dreary evening of loneliness began for me when lessons were over at four.
Father was in the habit of carrying into the dining-room grate the fire remaining in the classroom stove; and, little by little, the last boys who had lingered behind left the chilled building, thick with clouds of smoke.
There were still a few games, some galloping races in the playground, then night came; the two pupils who had swept the classroom fetched their hoods and cloaks, and with their baskets under their arms went away quickly, leaving the big gate open ...
Then, as long as there was a ray of light, I stopped in the record-room at the town hall, with its dead flies and posters that flapped in the draught, and I read, sitting on an old weighing-machine, close to a window looking on the garden.
When it was quite dark, and the dogs of the neighbouring farm began to howl and a light was seen at the window of our little kitchen, then I went home.
Mother had begun to get supper ready.
I climbed three steps of the attic stairs, sat down without a word and, leaning my head on the cold rails of the bannisters, watched Millie light her fire in this narrow kitchen where the flame of one candle flickered . . .
But some one has come who has taken from me these peaceful, childlike delights.
Some one has blown out the candle which lit up for me the gentle motherly face bent over the evening meal.
Some one has extinguished the lamp around which, at night, we were a happy family, when Father had fixed the wooden shutters over the glass doors.
And he was Augustin Meaulnes, whom the other fellows soon called 'Admiral Meaulnes.'
As soon as he became a boarder with us, that is, from the early days of December, the school was no longer deserted in the evening after four.
Every day then, in the classroom, despite the cold from the swinging door and the shouts and clatter of the cleaners with their pails of water, a score of the big boys, both those from the countryside and the village, gathered round Meaulnes.
Long discussions followed, never-ending arguments, into which I was drawn restlessly but with pleasure.
Meaulnes never said anything, but it was because of him that repeatedly one chatterbox or another, making of himself the centre of the group, and taking in turn each of his noisily approving friends as witness, would relate some long story of poaching, which the others followed with gaping mouths and inward laughter.
Sitting on a desk and swinging his legs, Meaulnes was thoughtful.
At exciting moments he used also to laugh, but softly, as though he reserved his real laughter for some better story known only to himself.
Then, as night fell and no more light came from the classroom windows on the throng of boys, Meaulnes used suddenly to get up, and pushing his way through, call out:
'Come on! Let's go!'
Then all followed him and until pitch dark one could hear them shouting, towards the heights of the village.
It came about now that I went with them.
With Meaulnes, I went at milking-time to barn doors just outside the village. We entered shops, and the weaver, between two clicks of his loom, used to say out of his darkness:
'Ha! the schoolboys.'
Generally, at dinner-time, we were to be found near the Higher Elementary School with Desnoues, the wheelwright, who was also a blacksmith.
His shop was an old inn with big double-leaf doors, always kept open.
From the street you could hear the squeak of the forge bellows, and you could sometimes make out, by the glow of the forge fire, in this dark and noisy place, the country folk who had stopped their cart to have a chat, or a schoolboy like us, his back to a door, a silent onlooker.
And it is there that everything began, about eight days before Christmas.
III
I HAUNTED A BASKET-MAKER'S SHOP
Rain had fallen all day; it did not stop till evening.
The day had been deadly tedious.
No one went out at recreation, and all the time M. Seurel could be heard calling to the form:
'Don't make such a row, boys !'
After the last recreation of the day or, as we called it, the last 'quarter,' M. Seurel, who for a while had been walking to and fro lost in thought, suddenly stopped, banged vigorously on the table with a ruler to put an end to the confused buzz with which the last hour of a boring day ends, and, in the attentive silence, asked :
'Who will drive to the station to-morrow with François to fetch Monsieur and Madame Charpentier?'
These were my grandparents ; Grandfather Charpentier with his grey woollen burnous ; an old man, a retired gamekeeper wearing a rabbit fur bonnet which he called his képi. . . Little boys knew him well.
In the morning, to wash himself, he would draw a pail of water and slosh his face in the manner of old troopers, vaguely rubbing his small pointed beard.
A group of children, hands behind backs, watched him With respectful curiosity . . . They also knew Grandma Charpentier, the small peasant woman and her knitted cap - as Millie never failed to bring her, at least once, into the infants' class.
Each year, a few days before Christmas, we were in the habit of going to the station to meet the 4.2 train which brought them.
To come to us they had crossed the length of the 'département', dragging with them baskets full of chestnuts and other Christmas fare rolled up in napkins.
The moment the two, muffled up, smiling, and rather shy, had crossed the threshold, we shut all doors on them, and a glorious week of happiness began for us all.. .
To drive them from the station I needed a steady fellow with me, one who would not upset us into a ditch, and yet a gay lad, too, because Grandfather Charpentier was pretty free with swear words and Grandma rather talkative.
In answer to M. Seurel's question a dozen voices called out together:
'Admiral Meaulnes! Admiral Meaulnesl'
But M. Seurel pretended not to hear.
Then they shouted :
'Fromentin !'
Others :
'Jasmin Delouche !'
The youngest, Roy, the boy who rode across the fields on a sow at full gallop, called out in a piercing voice: 'Can I go?
Can I go?'
Dutremblay and Mouchebœuf rather shyly put up their hands.
I should have liked it to be Meaulnes.
This little drive, in a donkey cart, would have become a more important event.
He also longed for it, but remained scornfully silent.
All the big boys seated themselves, as he did, on the table, the wrong way round, feet on the bench, as we used to do in times of rest or great rejoicing.
Coffin, his overall rolled up round his belt, was hugging the iron pillar which supported the beam of the classroom and, in his excitement, was beginning to climb it.
But M. Seurel damped every one by saying :
'Good !
I choose Mouchebœuf.'
And each went back to his seat silently.
At four o'clock, in the big icy playground, hollowed into channels by the rain, I found myself alone with Meaulnes.
Without speaking, we both stood looking at the shining village drying under the high wind.
Soon little Coffin, wrapped in his hooded cloak and holding a piece of bread in his hand, came out of his home; walking close to the walls and whistling, he went straight for the door of the wheelwright.
Meaulnes opened the big gate, hailed the boy, and a moment later the three of us were settled at the back of the hot red shop, across which icy gusts of wind swept. Coffin and I sat close to the forge fire, our muddy feet amongst the white shavings ; Meaulnes, hands in pockets and silent, leaned against the leaf of the door.
From time to time a village woman, stooping to brave the wind, passed by in the street on her return from the butcher, and we looked up to see who she was.
No one spoke.
The blacksmith and his assistant - one blowing the bellows, the other beating the hot iron - threw big sharp shadows upon the wall... I recall that evening as one of the great evenings of my youth.
I felt both pleasure and anxiety; I was afraid my companion would deprive me of the small happiness of driving to the station, yet, without daring to own it to myself, I expected some extraordinary scheme from him which would upset everything.
From time to time the peaceful and regular work of the forge momentarily paused.
The smith let his hammer fall onto the anvil in a series of clear, strong blows.
He held the piece of iron on which he had been working close to his leather apron and looked at it.
Then, raising his head, he said to us, by way of taking an easy breath:
'Well, my lads ! How goes it?'
His man kept his right hand high up on the chain of the bellows, put his left hand on his hip, looked at us with a smile.
Then the din of hard work began again.
During one of these pauses, we caught sight of Millie through the swinging door, as she passed in the high wind, closely wrapped in her shawl and laden with small parcels.
The blacksmith asked :
'I suppose Monsieur Charpentier will be coming soon?'
'To-morrow, with Grandmother,' said I. 'I am going to meet the 4:02 train.'
'In Fromentin's cart, eh!'
I replied at once:
'No, in Father Martin's.'
'Ah! then you won't be back in a hurry!'
Both he and his man began to laugh.
His man, to say something, remarked slowly: 'With Fromentin's mare you could have fetched them from Vierzon.
There's an hour's wait there.
It is fifteen kilometres from here.
You could have got there and back afore Martin's donkey's harnessed.'
'Ah!' said the other, 'that mare has got some go in her, and surely Fromentin would gladly lend her.'
The conversation ended there.
The forge, once again, became the place of sparks and din where each had his own thoughts.
But when the time had come to leave and I got up to attract Meaulnes' attention, he did not notice me at first.
Leaning against the door, his head bent down in deep thought, he seemed absorbed in what had just been said.
Seeing him thus lost in thought, looking as though across leagues of fog at these quiet folk at their work, I was reminded suddenly of that picture in 'Robinson Crusoe,' where the young Englishman is seen on the eve of his great adventure 'haunting the shop of a basket-maker'. . .
And I have often thought of it since.
IV
THE ESCAPE
At two o'clock in the afternoon next day, in the centre of the freezing country, the form-room stands out clear as a ship on the ocean.
There is no smell of brine or tar as on a boat, but of herrings fried on the stove and of the scorched woollens of the boys who, on coming back, got too close to the fire.
As the end of the year is drawing near, the exercise books for term examination have been given out.
And while M. Seurel is setting problems on the board silence prevails, only disturbed by whispered conversations, or broken into by stifled exclamations and with sentences of which the first words alone are uttered to frighten one's neighbour:
'Sir!
So and So is . . .'
M. Seurel, writing out the problems, is thinking of something else.
From time to time he turns round and looks at us in a stern but vacant way.
And this covert disturbance stops entirely for a moment, to begin again immediately, softly at first like a purr.
I alone keep quiet in the midst of this turmoil.
I am sitting at the extreme end of one of the tables on the juniors' side and close to the high windows, and I need only raise myself a little to get a view of the garden, the stream at the lower end of it, and then the fields.
From time to time I stand on tiptoe and look anxiously towards the farm of the Fair Star.
As soon as the class opened I had noticed that Meaulnes had not come back after the dinner hour.
The boy next him certainly could not have failed to notice it too.
Too busy with exam work he has not yet said anything.
But as soon as he looks up the news will spread at once, and someone, as usual, will certainly call out, in a loud voice, the first words of the sentence:
'Sir!
Meaulnes. . .'
I know that Meaulnes has gone.
To be more exact I suspect him of having run away.
As soon as dinner was over he must have jumped over the low wall, taken his course through the fields, and crossed the stream on the old plank for the Fair Star.
He must have asked for the mare to go to the station for Monsieur and Madame Charpentier.
They are harnessing her this very moment.
The Fair Star, on the other side of the stream, where the hill slopes down, is a large farm hidden from our view in the summer by the oaks and elms in its yard and also by quick-set hedges.
It is situated in a little lane which joins the Station Road on one side and on the other an outlying district of the village.
The big feudal building is surrounded by high walls, the buttresses of which stand in pools of manure. In the month of June it is buried in leafage, and from the school the rumbling of carts and the shouts of the cowherds alone can be heard at nightfall.
But to-day, out of the window and between the stripped trees, I can see the tall grey wall of the farmyard, the entrance gate and then, through gaps in the hedge, a strip of road, white with frost, parallel to the stream and leading to the Station Road.
Nothing moves yet in that clear wintry lansdcape.
Nothing has yet changed.
In the classroom M. Seurel has almost finished writing out the second problem.
Generally he set down three.
If he only set two to-day . . . He would go back to his desk and notice the absence of Meaulnes.
He would send two boys to look for him in the village and they would find him before the mare was harnessed ...
M. Seurel, once the second problem is on the board, drops his tired arm. Then, to my great relief, he goes to the next line and begins to write again, saying:
'This one is only child's play!'
. . . Two little black streaks showing over the top of the wall at the Fair Star, certainly the upturned shafts of a cart, have now disappeared.
I feel sure that over there everything is being made ready for Meaulnes' departure.
Soon the head and the fore parts of the mare emerge between the posts of the gateway, then stop, while, no doubt, behind the cart, they are fixing a second seat for the travellers whom Meaulnes proposes to fetch.
At last the complete equipage slowly comes out of the yard, disappears for a moment behind the hedge, and, going at the same slow pace, shows itself again on the strip of white road visible between breaks in the fence.
Then I recognise, in the black figure holding the reins, one elbow lazily resting on the side of the cart in peasant fashion, my friend, Augustin Meaulnes.
A moment later everything disappears behind the hedge.
Two men who have remained by the gate, looking at the departing cart, begin to converse with increasing liveliness.
One of them at last decides to make a speaking-trumpet of his hands and to call after Meaulnes and then to run a few paces along the road in his direction. But then, in the cart, which slowly has reached the Station Road and can certainly no longer be seen from the lane, Meaulnes suddenly changes his attitude.
Standing up like the driver of a Roman chariot, one foot resting on the front bar and both hands shaking the reins, he sets his beast going at a gallop and in a moment disappears on the other side of the slope.
On the road the man who has been calling begins to run again, and the other, starting at full speed across the fields, seems to be coming towards us.
In a few minutes, just as M. Seurel having left the blackboard is rubbing the chalk off his hands and at the very moment when three voices call out together from the back of the classroom:
'Sir !
Admiral Meaulnes has gone !' the man with the blue smock is at the door, which he suddenly throws wide open and lifting his hat asks from the doorstep :
'Excuse me, sir, is it you as sent that pupil to ask for the cart to drive to Vierzon to meet your parents?
We began to suspect. ..'
'Certainly not!' replied M. Seurel.
And at once all the class is in frightful disorder.
The three boys close to the door, whose usual job is to chase away with stones the goats or the pigs which stray in the playground and browse the March Pride, rush out.
Following the loud clatter of their hobnailed clogs on the flagstones of the room are heard their muffled and hurried steps crushing the sand of the yard and skidding as they sharply turn by the little gate opening on the road.
The other boys have crowded to the garden windows.
Some have climbed on the table to see better ...
But it is too late.
Admiral Meaulnes has escaped.
'You will go to the station with Mouchebœuf all the same,' says M. Seurel to me.
'Meaulnes does not know the way to Vierzon.
He will lose himself at the Cross-Roads.
He will not meet the train at three.'
Millie pokes her head in at the door of the infants' classroom to ask:
'What on earth is the matter?'
In the village street people have begun to form groups.
The peasant stands there, hat in hand, obstinate, motionless, like a man demanding justice.
V
THE CART COMES BACK
When I had brought home my grandparents from the station and after dinner, seated in front of the large hearth, they began to relate in full detail all that had happened to them since the last holidays, I soon realised that I was not listening.
The little gate of the playground was quite near the dining- room door.
It used to squeak as it opened.
Generally at nightfall, during the long country evenings, I sat secretly waiting for this squeaking of the gate.
It was usually followed by the noise of clogs clattering or being wiped outside the door, and sometimes by whispers as of people making some plan before coming in.
There was a knock.
It was a neighbour, the women teachers... anyhow, some one who was coming to cheer us during these long hours.
But that evening I had nothing to hope for from outside, since all those I loved were met together in our house; and yet I continued to be alert to all the noises of the night and to wait for some one to open our door.
Old Grandfather was there, hairy and bushy in appearance like some big Gascon shepherd, his two feet firmly planted as he sat, his stick between his legs, and with the usual slant of his right shoulder when he stooped to tap the ashes from his pipe against his shoe.
He was approving with his kind moist eyes what Grandmother was saying about their journey, their neighbours, and the peasants who had not yet paid their rent.
But I was no longer with them.
I was imagining the rumbling of a cart which would suddenly stop at our door.
Meaulnes would jump from it and walk in as if nothing had happened ... Of perhaps he had first gone to take back the mare to the Fair Star, and I should soon hear his step sounding on the road, and the gate opening . . .
But nothing happened.
Grandfather was gazing fixedly in front of him and his winking eyelids kept closing over his eyes as at the approach of sleep.
Grandmother awkwardly repeated her last sentence, which no one was listening to.
'Is it about that boy that you are worried?' she said at last.
As a matter of fact, I had questioned her at the station to no purpose.
She had seen no one at Vierzon who might have been Admiral Meaulnes.
My friend must have been delayed on the way.
His attempt had failed.
During our return journey I had brooded over my disappointment, while Grandmother was chatting with Mouchebœuf.
On the road whitened with frost, small birds had been fluttering around the hoofs of the trotting donkey.
From time to time above the stillness of the wintry afternoon had arisen the far-away call of a farm girl or of a lad hailing a comrade from one clump of firs to another, and each time that long call over the desolate hills had made me shudder as if it were the voice of Meaulnes inviting me to follow him from afar . . .
While I was going over all this in my mind, bedtime came.
Already Grandfather had gone into the red room, the bed- sitting-room so damp and icy cold from having been closed since last winter.
To make him at home the lace antimacassars of the armchairs had been removed, the rugs folded up and all the knick-knacks put away.
He had placed his stick on a chair, his thick shoes under an armchair, he had just put out his candle and we were standing saying good-night, ready to retire to bed, when the noise of a cart silenced us.
It almost sounded as if two vehicles slowly followed each other at a very slow trot.
The noise finally came to a stop under the dining-room window which overlooked the road, but was never used.
Father had taken up the lamp and, without waiting, went to open the door which had already been locked.
Then pushing open the gate, he walked to the edge of the steps and raised his light above his head to see what was happening.
Two carts had in fact stopped, the horse of one fastened behind the back of the other.
A man had jumped down and was hesitating ...
'Is this the town hall?' said he, coming near.
'Could you direct me to M. Fromentin, the farmer at the Fair Star?
I have found his cart and mare without a driver, going along the lane, close to the road of Saint-Loup-des-Bois.
I was able to read his name and address on the plate, with my lantern.
As it was on my way, I brought back his trap round here to avoid accidents, but it has delayed me no end all the same.'
We stood there stupefied.
Father approached and lit up the cart with his lamp.
'There were no traces of a driver,' went on the man.
'Not even a rug.
The animal is tired and slightly lame.'
I had got quite at the front and, with the others, I was looking at this lost vehicle which had come back to us like wreckage washed ashore by the high tide—the first and perhaps the last wreckage of Meaulnes' adventure.
'If it's too far to Fromentin's,' said the man, 'I'll leave the cart with you.
I've lost too much time already and they must be anxious at home.'
Father agreed.
In this way we could take back the trap to the Fair Star that very evening without saying what had happened.
Then we could decide what we were to tell the village people and to write to Meaulnes' mother ... And the man whipped up his horse, refusing the glass of wine we offered.
As we were coming in without uttering a word and Father was leading the cart towards the farm, Grandfather, who had lit his candle again, called out from his room : 'Has that traveller come back then?'
The women consulted each other's faces by looks for a moment.
'Yes, he's been to his mother's.
Go to sleep.
Don't worry.'
'That's all right.
Just what I thought,' said he.
And, reassured, he put out his light and turned over in bed to sleep.
That was the explanation which we gave to the village people.
As to the mother of the runaway, it was decided to wait before writing to her.
And during three long days we kept our anxiety to ourselves.
I still see my father coming home from the farm towards eleven, his moustache damp with the evening mist, talking with Millie in a very low voice, anxious and angry . ..
VI SOME ONE KNOCKS AT THE WINDOW
The fourth day was one of the coldest of that winter.
From early morning the first comers to the playground kept warm by sliding round the well.
They were waiting for the stove to be lit to rush into the classroom.
Behind the front gate several of us waited for the arrival of the boys from the countryside farther off.
They came with eyes quite dazed from having crossed hoar-sparkling fields and looked on frozen ponds and coppices from which hares ran . . . Their overalls had a smell of hay and stables which made the air of the classrooms heavy, as they crowded round the red-hot stove.
And that morning one of them had brought in a basket a frozen squirrel which he had found on the way.
He tried, I remember, to hang up the long stiff animal by its claws to a pillar of the playground shelter . . .
Then the dull class-work of winter began.
A sharp knock on the window made us look up.
Upright against the door we saw Admiral Meaulnes shaking off the frost from his overall before he came in, standing there head erect and as if dazzled with rapture!
The two boys of the bench nearest to the door hurried to open it: they had a little confabulation, which we did not hear, just outside, and at last the truant made up his mind to come into the school.
That breath of fresh air coming from the deserted playground, the bits of straw which could be seen clinging to Admiral Meaulnes' clothing, and above all the look he had of a traveller, tired, hungry, but thrilled by wonders, all gave us a strange feeling of pleasure and curiosity.
M. Seurel had come down the two steps of his desk where he had been giving us a dictation, and Meaulnes walked towards him looking aggressive.
I recall how handsome he seemed to me then, that big friend of mine, in spite of his battered look and of his eyes reddened by nights spent, most likely, in the open.
He went up to the master's desk and said, in the assured voice of a man who brings news : 'I have come back, sir.'
'So I see,' replied M. Seurel, looking at him with curiosity ... 'Go to your seat.'
The boy turned towards us, his back slightly bent, smiling in a mocking way, as do big unruly fellows when punished, and, catching hold of the end of the table with one hand, he let himself drop on his bench.
'You are going to take out a book and read as I tell you,' said the master - all heads were turned then towards Meaulnes - 'while the others finish their dictation.'
And the lesson went on as before.
From time to time Admiral Meaulnes turned my way, then looked out of the windows from which the white garden was visible, downy and motionless, and the bare fields on which a crow sometimes descended.
In the classroom the heat was heavy around the reddened stove.
My friend settled himself to read, holding his head in his hands : twice I saw his eyelids close and I thought he was falling asleep.
'I'd like to go to bed, sir,' said he at last, half lifting his arm.
'I've not slept for three nights.'
'Then go!' said M. Seurel, anxious above all to avoid a scene.
We sat up, all of us, pens in the air, and sadly watched him go, his overall rumpled at the back and his shoes earthy.
How slow that morning was in passing !
Towards mid-day we heard the traveller, upstairs in the attic, preparing to come down.
At dinner time I found him sitting by the fire near our puzzled grandparents, and as the clock struck twelve the boys, big and little, scattered over the snowclad playground, made off like shadows before the dining-room door.
Of that dinner I recall only a great silence and a great distress.
Everything was icy; the oilcloth without a tablecloth, the cold wine in the glasses, the red flagstones under our feet. It had been decided to put no questions to the truant so as not to rouse him to revolt.
And he availed himself of that truce to say not a word.
At last, dessert ended, and we two were able to make a dash for the playground.
A school playground in the afternoon, with the snow trampled away by clogs ... a playground black all round with drips from the roofs of the shelters . . . a playground thick with games and screams !
Meaulnes and I pelted along by the school buildings.
At once two or three fellows from the village left their game and ran up to us with shouts of joy; hands in pockets, scarves unloosed, and mud squirting from under their clogs.
But my friend burst into the big classroom where I followed; he shut the glass door just in time to stop the rush of the fellows in pursuit.
There was instant uproar loud and clear; glass panes shaken, clogs stamping on stone; one shove bent the iron bar holding the two leaves of the door; but Meaulnes had already turned the little key in the lock, at the risk of cutting himself on its broken ring.
We used to think it maddening to behave like that.
In summer, fellows who were locked out in this way, would tear round at full speed into the garden and managed often to climb in at one of the windows, before you could shut them all.
But it was then December and everything was shut up.
For a little while the boys kept shoving against the door; they yelled insults at us; then, one by one, they turned tail and went off crestfallen, doing up their scarves as they went.
Only two boys were in the classroom, which smelt of chestnuts and sour wine, two sweepers who were shifting the tables.
I went up to the stove to warm myself lazily till lessons time, while Meaulnes searched the master's desk and the lockers.
He soon found a small atlas which he studied with eagerness as he stood on the platform, his elbows on the desk and his head in his hands.
I was just about to go up to him; I should have placed my hand on his shoulder and, no doubt, we should have followed together, on the map, the route which he had taken, when suddenly the door leading to the infants' room opened with a crash under a violent push, and Jasmin Delouche, followed by a village boy and three fellows from the neighbouring countryside, emerged with a shout of triumph.
One of the windows in the infants' classroom had probably been half shut ; they had pushed it open and jumped through.
Jasmin Delouche, although rather small, was one of the elder boys of the top form.
He was very jealous of Admiral Meaulnes, though he pretended to be his friend.
Before our boarder's arrival, Jasmin himself had been cock of the form.
He had a pale, rather sallow face, and pomaded hair.
He was the only son of widow Delouche, the innkeeper, and he played the man, trotting out with self-conceit what he had heard in the billiard-room and at the bar.
At his entry Meaulnes looked up frowning and called out to the boys, as they scrambled to the stove: 'So one can't have a minute's peace here!'
'If you don't like it, you should have stopped where you were,' said Jasmin Delouche, without looking up.
I think that Augustin was in that state when temper comes and gets you so that you cannot control it.
'Now then, you !' he said, a little pale, rising and shutting his book, 'get out of it!'
The other sneered.
'Oh!' he cried, 'because you ran away for three days, you think you are going to be boss now!' he went on, dragging in the others.
'A chap like you can't turn us out, I tell you that much!'
But Meaulnes was already on him.
A scrap began; a wild scrimmage; sleeves of overalls split and tore at the seams.
Martin alone - one of the boys of the neighbourhood who had come with Jasmin - interfered.
'Leave him alone!' he called out, with quivering nostrils, shaking his head like a ram.
With a violent jerk Meaulnes threw him reeling, arms out, to the middle of the room; then gripping Delouche by the neck with one hand and opening the door with the other, he tried to throw him out.
Jasmin clung to the tables and dragged his feet, making his hobnailed shoes grate on the flagstones, while Martin, having regained his balance, came back with measured steps, head forward and furious.
Meaulnes let go Delouche to collar this idiot, and would soon have found himself in a fix if the door of the living-room had not partly opened.
M. Seurel was seen standing there at the door, his back turned towards us, to finish, before he came in, a conversation he was having with some one . . .
At once the battle stopped.
Some boys collected round the stove, none too proud of themselves, having, right to the end, avoided taking sides.
Meaulnes sat down in his place, his sleeves undone and torn at the gathers.
As for Jasmin, purple in the face, during the few minutes before the ruler rapped for form-work to begin, he could be heard calling out: 'He can't stand anything now.
He puts on side.
Does he suppose we do not know where he's been!'
'You ass !
I don't know myself,' replied Meaulnes, in the immediate silence.
Then, shrugging his shoulders and burying his head in his hands, he began to do his work.
VII THE SILK WAISTCOAT
Our room was, as I have said, a big attic - half attic, half room.
The other rooms, meant for assistant masters, had windows ; no one knows why ours was lighted only by a skylight.
It was impossible to shut the door fast, as it scraped the floor.
When we went up in the evening, sheltering with one hand the candle which the draughts of the big house threatened to blow out, every time we tried to shut this door and every time we had to give it up.
And the whole night long we felt all round the silence of the three lumber-rooms penetrating our bedroom.
There we met again, Augustin and I, on the evening of that same winter day.
I swiftly took off all my clothes and threw them in a heap on a chair at the foot of my bed, but my companion, without saying a word, began to undress slowly.
I watched him undress from the iron bed in which I already lay - looking through cretonne hangings adorned with a wine-stalk pattern.
One moment he sat down on his low curtainless bed; the next he got up and paced to and fro as he undressed.
The candle, which he had placed on a wicker table, the work of gipsies, threw his moving and gigantic shadow upon the wall.
Quite unlike me he was folding and arranging his school clothes in a bitter and distracted way, but with much care. I still see him drop his heavy belt on a chair, over the back of which he folded his black overall extremely creased and soiled, then take off a kind of dark blue tunic which he wore under his overall, and stooping with his back to me, spread the garment at the foot of his bed . .. But when he stood up again and turned to face me, I saw that in place of the brass button uniform waistcoat that should be under the tunic, he was wearing a queer silk waistcoat, cut very open and fastened by a row of small and closely set mother-of-pearl buttons.
It was a garment of fantastic charm, such as must have been worn by the young men who used to dance with our grandmothers, in the days of the dandies.
I distinctly recall, at that moment, the tall peasant boy, bareheaded - for he had carefully placed his cap on his other clothes - his face so young, so gallant, and already so firmly set.
He was once more pacing the room when he began to unbutton this mysterious article of a costume which was not his.
And it was strange to see him, in shirt-sleeves, with short trousers and muddy shoes, handling this waistcoat of a marquis.
He had no sooner touched it than, starting from his reverie, he turned his face towards me with a look of anxiety.
I rather wanted to laugh.
He smiled with me and his face brightened.
'What's that? Do tell me,' I said in a low voice, emboldened.
'Where did you get it?'
But his smile vanished at once.
Twice, with his heavy hand, he brushed back his closely cropped hair, and suddenly, like a man unable to resist desire, slipped his tunic back over the dainty jabot, buttoned it up tightly, and slipped on his rumpled overall ; then he hesitated a moment, looking at me sideways ... Finally he sat on the edge of his bed, took off his shoes, which fell noisily onto the floor, stretched himself on the bed, fully dressed like a soldier ready for the fray, and blew out the candle.
About midnight I woke up suddenly.
Meaulnes was standing in the middle of the room, his cap on his head, and was looking for something on one of the pegs - a cloak which he threw on his back ... The room was very dark.
Not even that gleam of light which snow sometimes gives.
A black and icy wind was blowing in the garden and over the roof.
I raised myself a little and called to him softly: 'Meaulnes! Are you going away again?'
He did not reply.
Then, quite beside myself, I said : 'Very well, I shall go with you.
You must take me.'
And I jumped out of bed.
He came close to me, took hold of my arm, forcing me to sit on the edge of the bed, and said to me : 'I can't take you, François.
If I knew my way well, you should come with me.
But I must first of all find it on the map, and I can't.'
'Then you can't go either!'
'That's true. It's utterly useless,' he said, discouraged.
'Well, go back to bed.
I promise not to go without you.'
And he again began to pace to and fro in the room.
I dared say nothing more.
He kept walking, stopping and then setting off again more quickly like a man in search of memories which he sorts out, challenges and compares, ponders on, thinks he has discovered, and then the thread breaking the search begins once more . ..
That was not the only night on which, awakened by the sound of his steps, I found him thus, about one in the morning, treading the attic and lumber-rooms, as do sailors who cannot lose the habit of pacing the deck on night watch and who, in the quiet of their Breton holding, get up and dress of a night, at the regulation hour, to keep a land watch.
Two or three times, during the month of January and the first fortnight of February, I was roused out of my sleep in that way.
Admiral Meaulnes was there, on foot, all equipped, his cloak on his back, ready to start, and every time, on the edge of that mysterious country into which he once already had ventured, he stopped, he hesitated.
At the moment of lifting the latch of the door to the stairs and of slipping off by the kitchen door, which he could easily have opened without being heard, he would shrink back once more . . . Then, during the long midnight hours he paced feverishly the disused lumber- rooms, lost in thought.
At last one night, towards the fifteenth of February, he woke me up by gently placing his hand on my shoulder.
The day had been very disturbed.
Meaulnes, who had now entirely dropped out of all the games of his former comrades, had remained seated at his bench during the last recreation of the evening, busily sketching out a mysterious plan, following it with his finger and elaborately measuring it out on the atlas of the Cher.
There was an incessant going and coming between the playground and the classroom.
Clogs kept clattering.
Boys chased one another from table to table, taking benches and platform at a jump . . . Every one knew that it was not wise to come near Meaulnes when he was working thus; yet, as recreation continued past regulation time, two or three boys from the village advanced towards him for a joke, without any noise, and looked over his shoulder.
One of them was bold enough to push the others on top of Meaulnes . . . The latter hastily closed his atlas, hid his sheet of paper, and caught hold of the last of the three boys while the other two managed to escape.
It was that surly Giraudat, who began to whine, tried to kick, and at last was pushed out of doors by Admiral Meaulnes, to whom he shouted in a rage : 'You great coward ! No wonder they are all against you and want to make war on you ! . . .' and a lot of insults, to which we replied without having quite understood what he meant.
I was the one to shout the loudest, because I had sided with Admiral Meaulnes.
There was now a kind of pact between us.
The promise which he had given to take me with him, instead of saying, like everybody else, that I should not be able to stand the walking, had bound me to him forever.
And I never ceased thinking of his mysterious journey.
I had become convinced that he must have met a girl.
She, no doubt, was infinitely more beautiful than Jeanne, who could be seen in the nuns' garden by looking through the keyhole; or Madeleine, the baker's daughter, so pink and so fair; or Jenny, the daughter of the lady of the manor, so handsome, but insane and living in seclusion.
It was certainly of a young girl he was thinking at night, like the hero of a novel.
And I bravely decided to speak to him about it the first time he wakened me . . .
After four o'clock, on the evening of that new fight, we were both busy putting away garden tools, pickaxes, and spades which had been used to dig trenches, when we heard shouts on the road.
It was a troop of young boys and urchins, formed in fours, marching quickly like a well-drilled squad, led by Delouche, Daniel, Giraudat, and another whom we did not know.
They had spotted us and hooted like anything.
So all the village was against us, and some fresh soldier stunt, from which we were excluded, was being planned.
Meaulnes, without saying anything, put away in the shed the pickaxe and the spade which he had on his shoulder. But at midnight I felt his hand on my arm, and I woke up with a start.
'Get up,' he said, 'we are going.'
'Do you know the right way to the very end?'
'I know a good part of it.
And we shall have to find the rest,' he replied, with clenched teeth.
'Listen, Meaulnes,' I said, sitting up,'listen to me ; there's only one thing to be done! - and that is to look for the bit of the way we don't know in full daylight with the help of your map.'
'But that bit is far away from here.'
'All right, we'll drive there this summer, when the days are longer.'
There was a prolonged silence, which meant that he agreed.
'As we shall try together to find again the girl you love, Meaulnes,' I said at last,'tell me who she is, talk to me about her.'
He sat down at the foot of my bed.
I could see in the darkness his lowered head, his folded arms and his knees.
Then he took a deep breath, as some one who has had a weight upon his heart for a long time and who is, at last, going to tell his secret.. .
VIII THE ADVENTURE
My friend did not tell me that night all that had happened to him on the way.
And even when he decided to confide everything to me, during days of anguish of which I shall speak later, it remained for a long time the great secret of our youth.
But to-day when all is ended, and there remains only dust of so much good and so much evil, I can relate his strange adventure.
At half-past one in the afternoon on the Vierzon road, during that freezing weather, Meaulnes set his beast at a brisk pace, because he knew he was late.
At first he thought, with amusement, only of our surprise when, at four o'clock, he brought back Grandfather and Grandmother Charpentier.
For certainly, at that moment, he had no other intention.
Little by little, the cold being piercing, he wrapped his legs in a rug, which at first he had refused, but which the folk at the Fair Star had thrown into the cart.
At two o'clock he passed through the village of La Motte.
He had never gone through a small hamlet at school-time and was amused to see this one so empty, so asleep.
Here and there a curtain was moved, revealing the inquisitive face of a housewife.
Leaving La Motte, immediately after the schoolhouse, he hesitated between two roads, but seemed to remember that the left road led to Vierzon.
Nobody was there to tell him.
He once more put the mare to a trot, though the road became narrower and badly in need of repair.
He skirted a fir wood for some time, but at last, meeting a carter, he used his hands as a trumpet to inquire if he really were on the right road for Vierzon.
The mare pulled on the reins, without stopping her trot; the man must have failed to understand the inquiry; he called out something with a vague gesture, so Meaulnes chanced it and went on.
Once more there was the vast frozen plain without incident or distraction; only at times a magpie startled by the cart flew off to perch on a stunted elm in the distance.
The traveller had wrapped the big rug round his shoulders like a cloak.
He must have dozed for a long while with his legs stretched out and one elbow resting on the side of the cart. . .
. . . When Meaulnes recovered his wits, thanks to the cold penetrating the rug, he noticed a change in the countryside.
There was no longer the far horizon, no longer that stretch of pale sky in which sight was lost, but little meadows, still green, with high hedges.
On both sides water flowed under the ice in the ditches.
Everything showed the neighbourhood of a river.
And the road between the tall hedges was nothing more than a narrow rutted lane.
A moment before the mare had stopped trotting, Meaulnes tried to whip her up to the same pace again, but she persisted in walking with extreme slowness, and the big schoolboy, leaning forward, his hands resting on the dashboard, noticed that she was lame in one hind leg.
He was much troubled and at once jumped out.
'We shall never reach Vierzon in time for the train,' he said half aloud.
And he did not dare to own to himself the thought which upset him most, that perhaps he had lost his way and was no longer on the road to Vierzon.
For a long time he examined the beast's foot and could find no trace of a wound.
The mare was frightened and lifted her foot directly Meaulnes tried to touch it, pawing the ground with her heavy clumsy hoof.
At last he realised that she had simply got a stone in her shoe.
As a boy who was expert in the handling of beasts he sat on his heels and tried to grasp her right foot with his left hand and put it between his knees, but he was bothered by the cart.
Twice the mare got away and went on a few yards.
The step struck his head and the wheel hurt his knee.
He would not give in and ended by mastering the timid beast, but the stone was so embedded that Meaulnes was obliged to use his peasant's knife before he could get it out.
When he had finished the job and at last looked up, rather giddy and dim-eyed, he noticed with horror that night was falling . . .
Any one else but Meaulnes would immediately have turned back.
That was the only way not to get more badly lost.
But he reflected that he must be very far from La Motte.
Besides, the mare might have taken a byway while he was asleep.
Anyhow, this lane must lead to some village in time . . . In addition to all these reasons, the big boy, with his foot on the step and the mare already pulling on the reins, ached with exasperation to achieve something and to get somewhere, in defiance of every obstacle!
He whipped up the mare, who started and set off at a quick trot.
The darkness grew.
In the deep-cut lane there was now only just room for the cart.
Sometimes a dead branch from the hedge caught in the wheel and broke with a snap . . . When it was pitch dark Meaulnes thought suddenly with a pang of our dining-room at Sainte-Agathe in which, by this time, all of us ought to be together.
Then rage took him; then pride and the deep joy of having at last run away without premeditation . . .
IX A HALT
Suddenly the mare slowed down as if her foot had stumbled in the dark; Meaulnes saw her head sink and rise twice; then she stopped dead, her nostrils close to the ground, appearing to sniff at something.
The trickle of water could be heard by her feet.
A stream barred the way.
In summer that spot was certainly a ford.
But at this time of the year the current was so strong that ice had not formed and it would have been dangerous to push on.
Meaulnes gently pulled on the reins to go back a few yards and stood up in the cart full of perplexity.
It was then that he noticed a light between the branches.
Only two or three meadows seemed to separate it from the lane . . .
The schoolboy jumped down from the cart and backed the mare, talking to her to quiet her and to stop the frightened tossing of her head.
'Come on, old girl, come on.
We shan't go any farther now.
We shall soon know where we've got to.'
And pushing open the half-shut gate of a small meadow by the lane, he went through with the trap.
His feet sank deep into the soft grass.
The cart jolted silently.
His head was by the mare's head and he could feel her warmth and her hard breathing ... He took her to the far end of the meadow and threw the rug over her back; then thrusting aside the branches of the hedge, he again noticed the light which came from an isolated house.
None the less he had to cross three meadows and jump over a treacherous brook into which he nearly fell with both feet. . . At last, after a final leap from the top of a bank, he found himself in the yard of a rustic farm.
A pig was grunting in its sty.
At the noise of footsteps on the frozen ground a dog began to bark furiously.
The shutter over the door was open, and the light which Meaulnes had seen came from a wood fire burning on the hearth.
There was no other light but that of the fire.
In the house, a country woman rose from a chair and came to the door, with no sign of fear.
At the same moment the grandfather clock struck half-past seven.
'Excuse me, ma'am,' said the big boy, 'I believe I have trodden on your chrysanthemums.'
She waited, basin in hand, looking at him.
'The fact is,' she said, 'it's that dark in the yard you can't see your way.'
There was a moment's silence, during which Meaulnes stood looking at walls papered with pages out of illustrated papers, as they are in inns, and at the table on which lay a man's hat.
'He's not in, the boss,' he said, sitting down.
'He'll be back in a moment,' she replied, quite at her ease now, 'he's gone to fetch wood.'
'I don't exactly want him,' went on the young fellow, bringing his chair nearer to the fire, 'but out there a few of us - sportsmen, you know - are keeping a lookout.
I came to ask if you could spare us a little bread.'
Admiral Meaulnes knew quite well that with country folk, above all in an isolated farm, one must speak with caution, even with diplomacy, and above all never show that one does not belong to the district.
'Bread,' said she, 'we shan't be able to give you much.
The baker who always calls on a Tuesday hasn't come today . . .'
Augustin, who for a moment had hoped he was near a village, took fright.
'The baker, from where?' he asked.
'Why, of course, the baker from Vieux-Nançay,' replied the woman, astonished.
'How far is it exactly from here to Vieux-Nançay?' went on Meaulnes, very anxious.
'By the road I couldn't tell exactly; but by the short cut it is three leagues off.'
And she began to relate that her daughter was there in service, that she always walked all the way home on the first Sunday of the month, and that her master and mistress . . .
But Meaulnes, completely put out, interrupted her to say: 'Vieux-Nançay, would that be the nearest village from here?'
'No, the nearest is Les Landes, five kilometres off here.
But there are no shops and no baker at Landes, only just a small fair each year on Saint Martin's Day.'
Meaulnes had never heard of Les Landes.
He saw himself so much lost that he was almost tickled.
But the woman, busy at the sink washing her basin, turned round, inquisitive in her turn, and said slowly, looking at him quite straight : 'Don't you, then, belong to these parts? . . .'
At that moment an elderly peasant appeared at the door, carrying an armful of wood, which he threw on the stone floor.
The woman explained to him, in a very loud voice, as if he were deaf, what was required by the young man.
'Well, that's easy,' said he simply.
'But come nearer, you're getting no warmth from the fire.'
A moment later both were settled by the hearth; the old man breaking his wood to put on the fire, Meaulnes enjoying a bowl of milk and some bread which had been offered him.
Our traveller, delighted at finding himself in that humble dwelling after so many worries, and thinking that an end had come to his strange adventure, was already making plans for bringing friends with him in the future, to visit these kind people.
He did not know that this was only a halt, and that presently he was to resume his journey.
He soon asked to be shown the road to La Motte.
And, little by little, coming back to the truth, he related that he had been cut off, with his cart, from the other guns and now found himself completely lost.
Then the man and the woman insisted so much on his putting up at the farm and not starting before broad daylight, that Meaulnes in the end accepted, and walked out to fetch his mare and put her up in the stable.
'Mind holes in the path,' said the man.
Meaulnes dared not confess that he had not used 'the path.'
He neatly brought himself to ask if the good fellow could come with him.
For a second he hesitated on the threshold and so great was his indecision that he almost staggered.
But he went out into the gloom of the yard.
X
THE SHEEPFOLD
To find where he was he climbed on the bank from which he had jumped.
Slowly and with difficulty, as when he came, he made his way between swamps, through willow hedges, and went to fetch his cart at the farther end of the field where he had left it. The cart was no longer there.
Standing still, with throbbing temples, he strained hard to catch all the sounds of the night, sure that he heard, each moment, the jingle of the horse's collar close at hand.
Nothing . . . He went all round the meadow; the gate was partly open, partly dilapidated as if a cart wheel had passed over it.
The mare must have escaped that way, alone.
Turning back, he walked a little way and caught his feet in the rug which no doubt had slipped from the mare onto the ground.
This decided him that the beast had gone off in that direction.
He started to run.
Obsessed by the obstinate and insane resolve to overtake the cart, his face on fire, a prey to this panic wish, which resembled fear, he went on running . . . Sometimes he stumbled 42 in a rut.
In the utter darkness he ran into hedges when the lane turned, and too tired to stop in time he crashed into brambles, his arms stretched out, his hands torn in the effort to protect his face.
Sometimes he stopped and listened and went on again.
Once he thought he heard a cart, but it was only a jolting wagon going along a road, in the far distance on the left. . .
Came a time when the knee which he had grazed against the step of the cart hurt so much that he had to stop, his leg quite stiff.
Then he realised that unless the mare had run off at a quick gallop, he would long ago have caught her up.
He told himself, too, that a cart could not get lost in that way, and that some one would surely find it.
At last he retraced his steps, worn out, scarcely able to drag himself along.
After a while he believed that he was again in the neighbourhood of the place he had left, and soon he noticed the light of the house he was looking for.
A path opened in the hedge.
'That's the path the old man spoke of,' thought Augustin.
And he entered this passage, glad to have no more hedges and banks to get over.
Next moment, the path turning to the left, the light appeared to slip to the right, and Meaulnes reaching a cross-road, in his hurry to regain the poor lodging, without thinking took a path which seemed to lead straight there.
But he had hardly walked ten steps along it when the light disappeared, either because the hedge was hiding it, or else because the peasants were tired of waiting and had closed their shutters.
Bravely the schoolboy took to the fields and made for the place where the light had just been shining.
Then, leaping once more over a hedge, he landed on a new path. . .
Thus, little by little, Admiral Meaulnes' trail was tangled and the thread broke which was connecting him with those he had left.
Discouraged, almost exhausted, in despair he resolved to follow this path right to the end.
A hundred yards farther he emerged into a vast grey meadow, where here and there he could distinguish shadows appearing to be juniper trees and a dark shed in a fold of the ground.
Meaulnes drew near.
It was only a kind of large cattle pen or forsaken sheepfold.
The door yielded with a groan.
The light of the moon came through chinks in the woodwork, when the high wind chased the clouds.
Without searching farther, Meaulnes stretched himself on the damp straw, one elbow on the ground, his head on his hand.
Having removed his belt he curled up, knees bent in his overall.
He then thought of the mare's rug which he had left in the lane and felt so wretched and so cross with himself that he had a strong desire to cry . ..
So he forced himself to think of something else.
Frozen to the bone, he recalled a dream - or rather a vision which he had had when quite a child and of which he had never spoken to any one; one morning, instead of waking up in his room where his trousers and coat were hanging, he had found himself in a long green room with walls like foliage.
The light streaming into this place was so sweet that you could simply taste it.
Close to the first window a young girl was sewing with her back to him; she seemed to be waiting for him to wake. He had not had strength to creep out of bed into this enchanted dwelling.
He had fallen asleep again. But next time he swore he would get up.
To-morrow morning, perhaps ! ...
XI
THE MYSTERIOUS MANOR
At dawn he began to walk again.
But his swollen knee hurt him; he had to stop and sit down every moment, the pain was so sharp.
The place where he was happened to be the most desolate in Sologne.
During all the morning he saw, in the distance, only a farm girl bringing in her flock.
In vain he called to her and tried to run; she disappeared without hearing him.
Nevertheless he went on walking in her direction with a distressing slowness . . . Not a roof, not a soul.
Not even the cry of a curlew in the reeds of the marshes.
And above this complete solitude shone a December sun, clear and icy.
It might have been three o'clock in the afternoon when he noticed at last, above a fir wood, the spire of a grey turret.
'Some old forsaken manor,' thought he; 'some deserted dovecot!'
And without hurrying he went on his way.
At the corner of the wood, in between two white posts, appeared a drive which Meaulnes entered.
He walked up a few yards and stopped startled, disturbed by inexplicable feelings.
He walked with the same fatigue, the icy wind cut his lips and took his breath away, and yet a strange contentment urged him on, a perfect and almost intoxicating peace, the assurance that his goal had been reached and that he had now nothing but happiness to expect.
In the same way he once used to feel faint with excitement on the eve of great summer festivals, when fir trees, whose branches overshadowed his bedroom window, were set up at nightfall along the village streets.
'So much joy,' he said to himself, 'just because I am coming to this old dovecot full of owls and draughts ! . . .'
And angry with himself he stopped, wondering if it would be better to turn back and go on to the next village.
He had been thinking thus for a while, with head lowered, when he suddenly noticed that the drive had been swept clean in big regular circles as was usual at his home at festival time.
He was really in a lane which looked like the High Street of La Ferté on the morning of Assumption Day ! . . . Had he noticed at the bend of the drive a crowd of holiday-makers raising up the dust as in the month of June, he could not have been more surprised.
'Would there be a fête in this lonely spot?' he said to himself.
Advancing as far as the first bend, he heard the sound of approaching voices.
He stepped behind some bushy young firs, crouched and listened, holding his breath.
They were childish voices.
A group of children passed close to him.
One of them, probably a little girl, was speaking in a way so wise and so decided that Meaulnes, although he hardly caught the sense of her words, could not help smiling.
'One thing alone worries me,' she was saying, 'that is the question of the horses.
No one will ever prevent Daniel riding on the big bay pony.'
'No one will ever prevent me!' replied the mocking voice of a young boy; 'are we not allowed to do just as we please? . . . Even hurting ourselves, if we like . . .'
And the voices grew distant as another group of children approached.
'If the ice thaws,' said a little girl, 'to-morrow morning we shall go boating.'
'But shall we be allowed?' said another.
'You know very well that we are arranging things in our own way.'
'But suppose Frantz was to come back this very evening with his fiancée?'
'Well! he would do as we wish! . .
'No doubt a wedding,' thought Augustin.
'But the children lay down the law here! . . . Strange land!'
He wanted to come out of his hiding-place and ask them where he' could find something to eat and drink.
He stood up and saw the last group going away.
There were three little girls with pinafore dresses reaching to their knees.
They wore pretty hats with strings.
Down the neck of each hung a white feather.
One of them, half turning round and slightly leaning towards her friend, was listening to long explanations the other was giving with one finger raised.
'I should frighten them,' thought Meaulnes, looking at his ragged peasant overall and the queer belt of the schoolboys at Sainte-Agathe.
Fearing that the children would meet him on their way back along the drive, he passed on through the firs in the direction of the 'dovecot,' without considering at all what he could ask for there.
He was soon stopped at the edge of the wood by a low mossy wall.
On the other side, in between the wall and the outhouses of the estate, was a long narrow courtyard as full of carriages as the yard of an inn on the day of a fair.
These carriages were of all kinds and shapes: some elegant and small four-seaters with their shafts up in the air; wagonettes ; coaches quite out of date with their moulded cornices, and even some old berlins with windows raised.
Meaulnes, hidden behind the firs for fear of being seen, was examining the disorder of the place when he noticed, on the other side of the yard, just above the driver's seat of a tall wagonette, a window in one of the outhouses, half open.
Two iron bars, such as are often seen on stable shutters behind old manors, were meant to close this aperture, but time had loosened them.
'I will go in through there,' thought the schoolboy. 'I shall sleep in the hay and leave at daybreak without having frightened these lovely little girls.'
He climbed over the wall, painfully because of his wounded knee, and jumping from one carriage to another, from the coachman's box of a wagonette to the roof of a berlin, he hauled himself up to the window, which noiselessly opened under his push, like a door.
He found himself, not in a hayloft, but in a big room with low ceiling, which must have been a bedroom.
In the winter twilight one could make out that the table, the mantelpiece, and even the armchairs were covered with tall vases, objects of value, ancient weapons.
At the other end of the room hung curtains to conceal an alcove.
Meaulnes had closed the window, both because of the cold and for fear of being seen from outside.
He went to raise the curtains at the back of the room and disclosed a big low bed covered with old gilded books, lutes with broken strings, and chandeliers all thrown in a heap.
He pushed all these things to the back of the alcove, then stretched himself on this couch to rest and to ponder over the strange adventure which had befallen him.
A deep silence reigned over this domain.
Only at intervals the moaning of the high December wind could be heard.
And Meaulnes, stretched out, began to wonder if in spite of these strange meetings, in spite of the voices of the children in the drive, in spite of the carriages huddled together, the place was not simply, as he had thought at first, an old disused building in the winter wilderness.
Soon the wind seemed to bring him the sound of distant music.
It was like a memory full of charm and of regret.
He recalled the days when his mother, still young, used to come in the afternoon, and sit at the drawing-room piano and he, silently, from behind the door leading to the garden, listened to her until night. . .
'Surely it seems as if some one were playing the piano somewhere?' he thought.
But leaving his question without an answer, worn out with fatigue, he was soon asleep . . .
WELLINGTON'S ROOM
It was night when he awoke.
Chilled with cold he turned from side to side in his bed, crumpling and rolling his black overall under him.
A faint yellow light bathed the curtains of the alcove.
Sitting up on the bed he pushed his head between the curtains.
Some one had opened the window and had hung two green Chinese lanterns in the aperture.
But Meaulnes had scarcely time for one look around before he heard soft footsteps on the landing and whispers.
He started back into the alcove and his hobnailed shoes rang against one of the bronze ornaments which he had pushed close to the wall.
For an instant he held his breath in anxiety.
The footsteps were approaching and two shadows glided into the room.
'Don't make any noise,' said one.
'Well!' replied the other, 'it's high time he woke up!'
'Got his room ready?'
'Of course, just like the others.'
The wind made the window swing.
'Look,' said the first, 'you didn't even shut the window.
The wind has blown out one of the lanterns already.
We shall have to light it again.'
'Bah!' replied the other, suddenly lazy and discouraged, 'what's the good of these illuminations on the countryside, the desert side so to say?
There is nobody to see theml'
'Nobody?
But more people will be coming most of the night.
Down there, on the road, in their carriages, they will be glad to see our lights !'
Meaulnes heard a match struck.
The one who had spoken last, and who appeared to be the leader, went on in a drawling voice, like a gravedigger in Shakespeare :
'You are putting up green lanterns in the Wellington room.
You would just as soon put red . . . You know no more about it than I do!'
Silence.
'. . . Wellington, he was an American chap?
Well! Is green an American colour?
You're the travelled comedian, you ought to know that.'
'Oh ! Come off it !' replied the 'comedian.'
'Me, travelled?
Oh, yes ! I have travelled !
But I've seen nothing ! What can you see in a caravan?'
Meaulnes looked between the curtains with caution.
The manager was a fat bareheaded man, buried in a huge overcoat.
He held in his hand a long pole hung with lanterns of many colours, and with his legs crossed he quietly watched his companion work.
As for the comedian, he had the most woeful body imaginable.
Thin, tall, and shivering, with squinting greenish eyes, a moustache drooping over a toothless mouth, he called to mind the streaming face of a drowned man stretched on a slab.
He was in his shirt-sleeves and his jaws chattered.
He displayed in speech and gesture absolute contempt for his own person.
After a moment given to thought - both pitiful and laughable - with arms outstretched, he approached his partner and confided to him:
'Shall I tell you what? . . . I can't understand why they should have fetched rotters like us to help in such a fête!
Got that, my lad? . . .'
Disregarding this outburst of emotion, the fat man continued to watch the work with his legs crossed, yawned, quietly sniffed, and then turning his back went away with the pole on his shoulder, saying : 'Come on !
It's time to dress for dinner.'
The bohemian followed him, but as he passed in front of the alcove :
'Sir Sleeper !' said he, with courtly bows and a clown's diction, 'it's up to you now to wake up and dress like a marquis even though you're only a pot-boy like me, and you will descend to the fancy-dress ball, since that is the good pleasure of these little gentlemen and of these little ladies.'
He added, in the tone of a quack at a fair, with a final bow: 'Our friend Maloyau, of the kitchen department, will present the character of Harlequin and your humble servant that of tall Pierrot. . .'
XIII
THE STRANGE FESTIVAL
As soon as they had disappeared, the schoolboy came out of his hiding-place.
His feet were frozen, his joints stiff, but he was rested and his knee seemed healed.
'Come down to dinner?' thought he, 'I certainly shall.
I shall simply be a guest whose name every one has forgotten.
Besides, I am not an intruder here.
It is quite clear that M. Maloyau and his companion were expecting me . . .'
Coming out of the absolute darkness of the alcove, he managed to see fairly well about the room, by the light of the green lantern.
The bohemian had 'decorated' it.
Cloaks had been hung from curtain hooks.
On a heavy dressing-table, with its broken marble top, was displayed all that was necessary to transform into a beau any lad who might have spent the previous night in a forsaken sheepfold.
A matchbox lay on the mantelpiece by the side of a tall candlestick.
But they had neglected to polish the floor, and Meaulnes was aware of sand and rubbish under his shoes.
Again he had the impression of being in a house which had been disused for a long time. Going towards the fireplace he nearly stumbled over a pile of cardboard boxes large and small; he reached out an arm, lit the candle, then lifted the lids of the boxes and stooped down to look.
He found young men's costumes of days long gone by, frock coats with high velvet collars, dainty waistcoats cut very open, interminable white cravats, and patent-leather shoes dating from the beginning of the century.
He dared not touch a thing even with his finger-tips ; but shivering as he cleaned himself, he put one of the long cloaks over his schoolboy overall and raised its pleated collar; he changed his hobnailed shoes for elegant pumps and prepared to go downstairs bareheaded.
He reached the bottom of a wooden staircase in a dark corner of the yard, without meeting any one.
The icy night air blew on his face and raised one side of his cloak.
He took a few steps and thanks to the faint clearness of the sky he was at once able to get an idea of his surroundings.
He was in a little yard formed by outhouse buildings.
Everything appeared old and ruined.
Gaps yawned at the bottom of the staircase, for the doors had long since been removed; nor had the panes been replaced in the windows, which made black holes in the walls.
Yet all these buildings had a mysterious holiday aspect.
A coloured reflection hovered about in the low rooms, where also lanterns must have been lit looking on the countryside.
The ground had been swept, invading weeds pulled up.
Meaulnes, listening, thought he heard something like a song, like children's and young girls' voices down there towards the shadowy buildings where the wind shook the branches in front of the pink, green, and blue opening of the windows.
There he was, in his long cloak, like a hunter, stooping to listen, when an extraordinary little fellow came out of a neighbouring building any one would have thought deserted.
This little fellow wore a top hat very much curved in, which shone in the night as if made of silver, a frock coat with its collar reaching his hair, a low-cut waistcoat, and peg-top trousers . . . This dandy, who might have been fifteen, was walking on tiptoe as though lifted up by the elastic straps of his trousers, but very swiftly.
He greeted Meaulnes as they met without stopping, automatically bowing low, and disappeared in the darkness in the direction of the central building, farm, castle, or abbey, the turret of which had guided the schoolboy early in the afternoon.
After a moment's hesitation, our hero followed in the wake of the strange little personage.
They crossed a wide open space, half garden, half yard, passed in between clumps of bushes, went around a fenced fish-pond, then a well, and found themselves at last at the entrance of the central building.
A heavy wooden door, rounded at the top and studded with nails like a church door, was half open.
The dandy hurried in; Meaulnes followed him and from his first steps in the corridor, he found himself, without seeing any one, in the midst of laughter, songs, shouts, and chases.
A passage ran across the end of the corridor.
Meaulnes was hesitating whether to push on to the end or open one of the doors behind which he could hear voices, when he saw two little girls, at the end, chasing each other.
He ran to see them and catch them up, moving noiselessly in his pumps.
A sound of opening doors, two faces of fifteen which the freshness of the evening and the chase had made quite rosy under their poke bonnets, and everything disappeared in a sudden glare of light.
For an instant they twirled round in fun, their wide light skirts rose and bellied up ; one could see the lace of their long quaint drawers ; then, after this pirouette, they bounced into the room together and shut the door again.
Meaulnes remained for a moment dazed and staggering in this dark corridor.
He now feared to be discovered.
His clumsy and hesitating gait might lead him to be mistaken for a thief.
He deliberately retraced his steps towards the front door, when again he heard a sound of steps and children's voices at the end of the corridor.
Two little boys were talking as they approached.
'Will dinner be ready soon?' Meaulnes asked them with assurance.
'Come with us,' replied the bigger of the two, 'we'll take you in.'
And with that ease and need of friendliness which children have before a great party, they each took hold of one of Meaulnes' hands.
Most likely they were two little peasant boys.
They had been dressed in their best clothes : short knickers above the knees, which showed their thick woollen stockings and their heavy boots, a small blue velvet jacket, a cap of the same colour, and a white necktie.
'Do you know her?' asked one of the children.
'Me,' said the smaller one, who had a round head and naïve eyes; 'Mummy says that she had a black dress and a round collar and that she looked like a pretty Pierrot.'
'Whom do you mean?' asked Meaulnes.
'Why ! Frantz's fiancée, whom he has gone to fetch . . .'
Before Meaulnes could say anything, the three of them reached the door of a large room where a big fire was burning. For table, boards had been placed on trestles; white tablecloths had been spread and people of all kinds were dining with ceremony.
THE STRANGE FESTIVAL
It was a meal spread in a great room with a low ceiling, like those offered on the eve of a country wedding to relatives who had come from a distance.
The two children had let go the schoolboy's hands and had rushed into an adjoining room from whence could be heard childish voices and the clatter of spoons on plates.
Meaulnes climbed over a bench boldly and calmly and found himself seated beside two old peasant women.
He at once began to eat with fierce appetite; and only after a while did he raise his head to look at other guests and listen.
Little, as a matter of fact, was being said.
These folk seemed but slightly acquainted.
They must have come, some from far off in the country, others from distant towns.
Scattered about along the tables were some old men with side whiskers and others clean-shaven, who might have been old sailors. Dining near them other old men looked very much like the first: the same tanned faces, the same sharp eyes under bushy eyebrows, the same narrow ties like shoestrings.
But it was easy to see that these had never voyaged farther than the other end of the parish, and if they had been tossed and beaten by winds and storms it had occurred on that rough yet undangerous voyage in cutting the furrow to the field end and guiding back the plough. Few women were to be seen; only some old peasants with round faces as wrinkled as apples under their goffered caps.
With every one of these guests Meaulnes felt confident and at ease.
Later he came to explain that feeling by saying: If you have ever done something unpardonable you sometimes think, in the midst of much bitterness : 'Yet there are people in the world who would forgive me.'
You imagine old people, indulgent grandparents, who are, beforehand, certain that all you do is well done.
Undoubtedly the guests in the hall had been chosen from good folk of that kind; the rest were young people and children.
Meanwhile, two old women were chatting close to Meaulnes.
'Even if all is for the best,' said the elder, in a very shrill comical voice which she vainly tried to soften, 'the lovers will not be here before three o'clock to-morrow.'
'Be quiet ! or you'll make me angry,' replied the other in the most peaceful manner.
She was wearing over her forehead a knitted hood.
'Let's work it out!' replied the first, undisturbed.
'An hour and a half by train from Bourges to Vierzon and seven leagues by coach from Vierzon here . . .'
The talk went on.
Meaulnes lost not a word.
This friendly squabble helped to clear matters up a little. Frantz de Galais, the son of the house - who was a student or a sailor or perhaps a cadet in the Navy, one could not be sure - had gone to Bourges to fetch a young girl and marry her; strange to say, this boy, who must be very young and very fantastic, arranged everything in his own way at the manor.
He had wanted the house where his fiancée was to live to look like a festive palace.
And to welcome the young girl he had himself invited these children and these kind-hearted old people.
Such were the points which the discussion of the two women elucidated.
They left everything else in mystery and always came back to the question of the lovers' return.
The one insisted on to-morrow morning, the other on to-morrow afternoon.
'Poor old Moinelle, you always are so stupid,' said the younger quietly.
'Poor Adèle, you're always so obstinate.
I haven't seen you for four years and you haven't changed an atom,' replied the other with a shrug of her shoulders, but in the most peaceful voice.
And thus they had it out together, without the least bad feeling.
Meaulnes joined in with the hope of learning more: 'Is she as pretty as people say, Frantz's sweetheart?'
They looked at him bewildered.
No one but Frantz had seen the girl.
Coming home from Toulon one evening, he had found her wandering in great distress in one of the gardens of Bourges which are called Les Marais.
Her father, a weaver, had turned her out of the house.
She was very pretty and Frantz had decided at once to marry her.
It was a strange story, but had not his father M. de Galais and his sister Yvonne always allowed him to do as he liked !
Meaulnes was cautiously going to put other questions when a charming couple appeared at the doorway; a girl of sixteen wearing a velvet bodice and a skirt with deep flounces, a young fellow in peg-top trousers and a frock coat with a high collar.
They crossed the room dancing a pas de deux-, others followed, then again others rushed through screaming and chased by a tall ghastly Pierrot in dangling sleeves, who wore a black cap and smiled from a toothless mouth.
He was running in big clumsy strides, as if each step preceded a jump, and he flapped his long empty sleeves.
The girls were a little frightened of him, the young men shook him by the hand, and he appeared to be the delight of the children, who chased him with shrieks and laughter.
As he passed he looked at Meaulnes with his glassy eyes, and the schoolboy thought he recognised, now completely clean-shaven, the companion of M. Maloyau, the bohemian who a little while before was hanging up the lanterns.
The meal ended.
Every one rose.
In the corridors round games and country dances began.
A band played a minuet somewhere. Meaulnes, with his head half hidden by the collar of his cloak, as by a ruff, felt himself a different person.
He, too, caught the fun of it all and began to chase the tall Pierrot through the corridors, now like the wings of a theatre where the play had overflowed from the stage, in every direction.
He thus found himself part of a gay crowd in extravagant fancy dress.
Sometimes he opened a door and was in a room with a magic lantern. Children clapped loudly.
Sometimes, in a corner of the room devoted to dancing, he talked with some dandy and tried hastily to find out the sort of dress to be worn on the days following.
Rather troubled at last by all this gaiety offered him, and every moment fearing lest his partly open cloak would reveal his schoolboy overall, he sought refuge for a while in the quietest and darkest part of the dwelling.
No other sound could be heard there but the muffled music of a piano.
He entered another door and found himself in a dining-room lit by a hanging lamp.
There also fun was on, but fun for the children.
Some of these, seated on hassocks, were busy turning over the pages of albums open on their knees ; others, squatting on the floor in front of a chair, were gravely engaged in displaying pictures on the seat; others, again, near the fire said nothing and did nothing but listen to the hum of the fête audible throughout the great house.
One door of this dining-room was wide open.
In the next room could be heard the piano being played.
Meaulnes, inquisitively, put his head in.
It was a sort of drawing-room parlour; a woman or a young girl, with a brown cloak thrown over her shoulders and her back turned, was very softly playing tunes of round games and nursery rhymes.
Close to her, on the sofa, six or seven little boys and girls sat in a row as in a picture, good as children are when it grows late, and listened.
Only now and again one of them, using his wrist as prop, lifted himself up, slid down to the ground, and passed into the dining- room; then one of those who had finished looking at the pictures came to take his place.
After the ball where everything was charming but feverish and mad, where he had himself so madly chased the tall Pierrot, Meaulnes found that he had dropped into the most peaceful happiness on earth.
Noiselessly, while the girl played on, he went back to sit in the dining-room, and opening one of the big red books scattered on the table, he absent-mindedly began to read.
Almost at once one of the little boys crouched on the floor came up to him, and catching hold of his arm, climbed on his knee to look over; another settled on the other side.
Then began a dream like his old dream.
His mind could dwell on the fancy that he was married and in his own home during a beautiful evening and that this lovely unknown person playing the piano, close to him, was his wife.
THE MEETING
ISsfext morning Meaulnes was one of the first to be ready.
He put on, as he had been told, a simple black old-fashioned suit; a tight-waisted jacket with sleeves puffed out at the shoulders, a double-breasted waistcoat, trousers so wide at the bottom that they hid his dainty shoes, and a top hat.
The courtyard was deserted when he came down.
He took a few steps and felt projected into a day of spring.
It proved, indeed, to be the most lovely morning of that winter, sunny as in the first days of April.
The frost was giving way and the damp grass shone as with dewdrops.
In the trees many small birds were singing, and from time to time a warm breeze touched his face as he walked.
He behaved as guests do who wake before their host.
He went out into the courtyard, thinking that, at any moment, a friendly and gay voice would call from behind him: 'Up already, Augustin?'
But he walked alone for a long time in the garden and in the courtyard.
Over there, in the main building, nothing stirred, either in the windows or in the turret.
Yet the two wings of the heavy-studded door were already open.
And at one of the top windows a ray of sunshine shone as in summer in the early morning.
Meaulnes for the first time saw the grounds of the manor in broad daylight.
Remains of a wall separated the unkept garden from the courtyard, where quite recently sand had been spread and smoothed over with the rake.
At the end of the annex where his room was stood stables built in quaint disorder, which multiplied corners thick with ramping bushes and Virginia creeper.
The fir woods, which hid the manor from all the flat country around, encroached onto the very grounds - except towards the east where could be seen blue hills covered with rocks and yet more firs.
For one moment, in the garden, Meaulnes leaned over the shaky fence enclosing the fish-pond; near the edges there remained a little thin ice in folds like froth . . .
He saw himself reflected in the water, as if bending over the sky in his romantic student's costume.
And he fancied it was another Meaulnes; no longer the schoolboy who had run away in a peasant's cart, but a charming youth of romance from the pages of some handsome prize-book . . .
He hurried towards the main building, for he was hungry.
A peasant woman was laying the table in the large hall where he had dined the previous evening.
As soon as Meaulnes sat down in front of one of the bowls set in a line on the cloth, she poured him some coffee and said : 'You are the first down, sir?'
He did not wish to answer lest he should suddenly be recognized as a stranger.
He only asked at what time the boat would leave for the morning excursion which had been announced.
'Not for half an hour, sir. No one has come down yet,' was the reply.
So he continued to wander in search of the landing-stage, all around this long castle-like house, built with unequal wings in the style of a church.
When he turned round the south wing, he suddenly saw the reeds which, as far as the eyes could reach, formed the landscape.
Water from the ponds bathed the foot of the walls on that side, and in front of several doors little wooden balconies overhung the rippling wavelets.
The youth, idly, rambled at leisure along a shore sandy as a towing-path.
He peered through the dusty panes of large doors into dilapidated or forsaken rooms and sheds encumbered with wheelbarrows, rusted tools, and broken flower pots, when, suddenly, at the other end of the building, he heard footsteps crunching the sand.
Two women were approaching, one very old and bent, the other a young girl, fair and slender, whose charming dress, after all the fancy costumes of the previous evening, at first appeared strange to Meaulnes.
They stopped a moment to look at the view, while Meaulnes said to himself, with an astonishment which he later viewed as vulgar : 'That girl must be what is called eccentric - perhaps an actress who has been asked for the fête.'
Meanwhile, the two women passed close to him, and Meaulnes, motionless, watched the girl.
Often, in after days, when falling asleep, after having tried in vain to recall the 62 beautiful elusive face, rows of young women, not unlike this one, would pass before him in his dream.
One had a hat like hers, another her slightly drooping head; this one her clear gaze, this other her small waist and yet another her blue eyes ; but none of these women was ever the tall young girl.
Meaulnes had time to notice under the mass of fair hair a face, rather short but with features outlined with almost painful delicacy.
And when she had passed, he observed that she wore what was certainly the most simple and sensible of dresses.
In some perplexity he was asking himself if he should accompany them, when the girl, turning imperceptibly towards him, said to her companion: 'Surely the boat will soon be here, now? . .
And Meaulnes followed them.
The old lady, shaky and worn with age, never ceased chatting and laughing.
The girl answered her gently.
And when they walked down to the landing- stage she once again had that innocent grave look which seemed to say: 'Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I don't know you.
And yet it seems to me that I do know you.'
Other guests were now scattered amongst the trees, waiting.
Three pleasure boats came to the shore, ready to take the holiday-makers on board.
One by one, as the women, who seemed to be the lady of the manor and her daughter, passed by, the young men bowed low and the girls curtsied.
Strange morning !
Strange pleasure party !
It was cold, in spite of the winter sun, and the women were twisting round their necks those feather boas which were then fashionable.
The old lady remained on shore and, without knowing how, Meaulnes found himself in the same boat as the young lady of the manor.
He leaned at the side of the deck, one hand holding on his hat in the high wind, and he was able to watch at his ease the girl who sat in shelter.
She watched him, too.
She answered her friends, smiled, and then gently let her blue eyes rest on him, biting her lip a little.
There was deep silence on the near banks.
The boat glided on with a quiet sound of engine and water.
It was easy to imagine one was in the heart of summer.
They were going to land, so it seemed, in the beautiful garden of some country house.
There, the girl would walk about under a white sunshade.
Until evening the moan of doves would be heard . . . But suddenly an icy blast came to remind the guests at this strange fête that it was December.
They landed in front of a fir wood.
On the landing-stage, the passengers had to wait a moment huddled, one against the other, while one of the boatmen unlocked the gate. With what joy, in after days, Meaulnes recalled the one minute when, on the shore of the lake, he had felt, close to his own, the girl's face, since lost!
He had gazed at that profile, so pure, until his eyes had nearly filled with tears.
And he remembered having seen, like a delicate secret she had confided to him, a little powder on her cheek . . .
On land everything happened as in a dream.
While the children ran about with shouts of joy, while groups formed and scattered through the woods, Meaulnes entered a path where ten paces ahead of him the girl was walking.
He was close to her without having had time to think. 'You are lovely,' he said simply.
But she hurried on and without replying turned off along another path.
Other people were playing and running about the avenues, each wandering where the fancy took him.
The young man sharply reproached himself with what he called his thick-headedness, his grossness, his stupidity.
He rambled on aimlessly, convinced that he would never again set eye on this gracious being, when suddenly he saw her approaching and forced to pass close to him in the narrow path.
With two bare hands, she pushed the folds of her long cloak out of the way.
She wore black shoes cut very open.
Her ankles were so slender that at times they appeared to bend and you feared they might break.
This time, the young man took off his hat and said very softly: 'Will you forgive me?'
'I forgive you,' she said gravely.
'But I must go back to the children, as they are the masters to-day.
Good-bye.'
Augustin begged her to stay a moment longer.
He spoke to her awkwardly, but in a voice so agitated and so disturbed, that she walked more slowly and listened to him.
'I do not even know who you are,' she said at last.
She spoke in an even tone, dwelling on each word in the same way, but saying the last one more softly. . . Then she regained her steady look, still biting her lips a little, and her blue eyes looked into the distance.
'I do not know your name either,' replied Meaulnes.
They were following a lane no longer under the cover of the woods, and some way off the guests could be seen crowding around an isolated house in the open country.
'Here is "Frantz's House," said the girl. 'I must leave you . . .'
She hesitated, looked at him a moment, and smiling, said: 'My name? ... I am Mademoiselle Yvonne de Galais . . .'
And she hurried away.
"Frantz's House" was then uninhabited.
But Meaulnes found it invaded, up to the attics, by the crowd of guests.
He had scarcely leisure, however, to examine the spot where he now stood; they all hastened to eat a cold lunch which had been brought in the boats and which was hardly seasonable, but most likely the children had decided on it; then they set off again.
Meaulnes came close to Mademoiselle de Galais as soon as he saw her leave the house, and in answer to what she had said previously:
'The name I had given you was much nicer,' he said.
'How is that?
What was the name?' she replied, always with the same seriousness.
But he was afraid of having said something silly, and he did not answer.
'Well, my own name is Augustin Meaulnes,' he went on, 'and I am a student.'
'Oh! you are studying?' she said.
And they spoke a moment longer.
They spoke slowly with happiness - with friendship.
Then the girl's attitude changed.
Less haughty and less serious, she now also seemed more uneasy.
She seemed to be dreading what Augustin might say and was troubled beforehand.
She was close to him, trembling like a swallow alighted for a moment on the ground and already quivering with the longing to resume its flight.
'What is the good?
What is the good?' she replied gently to the plans which Meaulnes proposed.
But then at last he dared to ask her permission to come back one day to this delightful manor.
'I will wait for you,' she replied simply.
They came in sight of the landing-stage.
She stopped suddenly and said thoughtfully: 'We are two children, we have behaved foolishly.
We mustn't get into the same boat this time.
Good-bye; do not follow me.'
For an instant Meaulnes remained dumbfounded, watching her go away.
Then he continued his walk.
And the girl in the distance, stopped at the moment of disappearing in the crowd of guests, and turning, for the first time, took a long look at him.
Was that a last farewell?
Was it to forbid him to follow her?
Or had she perhaps something else to tell him? . . .
As soon as they returned to the manor the pony-race started in a big meadow that sloped down at the back of the farm.
It was the last item of the fête.
According to the arrangements the fiancés were to arrive for it and Frantz was to manage it all.
Yet they had to begin without him.
The boys in their jockey suits and the little girls as horsewomen led in some frisky ponies decked with ribbons as well as very old docile horses, amid shouts, children's laughter, betting, and prolonged sounding of the bell. One could have fancied one's self on the green and newly mown turf of a miniature race-course.
Meaulnes spotted Daniel and the little girls with feathers in their hats whose voices he had heard the day before in the drive near the wood. . . . The other part of the show was lost on him, so great was his anxiety to find, among the crowd, the charming hat trimmed with roses and the long brown cloak.
But Mademoiselle de Galais never appeared.
He was still looking for her when a full peal of the bell and joyful hurrahs announced that the race was over.
A little girl mounted on an old white mare had won the prize.
She proudly passed by on her mount, the feather of her hat fluttering in the wind.
Then suddenly all was still.
The games were ended and Frantz had not come back.
There was a moment of hesitation; people consulted uneasily.
At last, in groups, the guests went back to the house to await in silence and anxiety the homecoming of the engaged couple.
XVI
FRANTZ DE GALAIS
The race had ended too soon.
It was half-past four and still daylight when Meaulnes found himself again in his room, his head full of the events of this extraordinary day.
He sat down idly at the table, waiting for the dinner and the fête which would follow.
The great wind which had blown on the first evening blew again.
It could be heard roaring like a torrent or passing by with the insistent hiss of a waterfall.
Every now and then the damper in the grate shook.
For the first time Meaulnes felt the little pang that gets you at the close of too lovely a day.
It occurred to him to light a fire, but he tried vainly to raise the rusted damper.
Then he began to tidy the room; he hung up his handsome clothes on the pegs, arranged the disordered chairs in a row along the walls, as if he were anxious to make preparations for a long stay.
Remembering, however, that he ought to be ready to leave at a moment's notice, he carefully folded his overall and his other school things like travelling clothes on the back of a chair and put his hobnailed shoes, still thick with mud, under the chair.
Then he sat down again and, feeling calmer, inspected his dwelling-room now set in order.
From time to time a drop of rain left a streak on the window which looked on the stable-yard and the fir wood.
At peace since he had tidied his room, the big boy felt perfectly happy.
There he was, mysterious, a stranger in the midst of this un- 68 known world, in the room he had chosen.
What he had found surpassed all his hopes. And it was enough now for his joy to recall, in the high wind, the face of that girl who turned towards him. . .
Night had fallen during this reverie, and he had not given a thought even to lighting the tall candles.
A gust of wind banged the door of the dressing-room adjoining his, which also looked on the stable-yard.
Meaulnes was about to close it when he noticed, in that room, a faint light as of a candle burning on the table.
He put his head through the half-open door.
Some one had got in there, by the window, no doubt, and was walking up and down with silent tread.
So far as one could see it was a very young man with a long travelling cloak on his shoulders.
Bareheaded, this young man paced up and down without a stop, like one distracted by some unbearable grief.
From the window, which he had left wide open, the wind made his cloak flutter, and each time he passed close to the light a glint of brass buttons on his handsome frock coat caught the eye.
He was whistling between his teeth a kind of chanty such as sailors and prostitutes sing, to keep up their spirits in the pot-houses of seaports.
He stopped for an instant in the midst of his troubled walk, leaned over the table, searched in a box, took out several sheets of paper ... By the light of the candle Meaulnes saw in profile very fine and very aquiline features, clean-shaven, under a thick head of hair which was parted on one side.
He had stopped whistling.
He was very pale; his lips were half open and he seemed short of breath as if he had received a violent blow on the heart.
Meaulnes wondered whether it would be wise to retire or to go in and put a hand on his shoulder like a friend and talk to him.
But the other raised his head and saw him.
He looked at him for a moment; then, without surprise, came up and said, steadying his voice :
'I do not know you, sir, but I am pleased to see you.
As you are here it is to you I will explain . . . Listen! . .
He appeared completely broken.
After he had said 'Listen,' he caught hold of Meaulnes by his coat lapel, as though to fix his attention.
Then he turned his head towards the window, as if to collect his thoughts, blinked - and Meaulnes realized that he badly wanted to cry.
But suddenly he swallowed back this childlike grief and, still gazing at the window, he went on in an altered voice :
'Well! listen; it's all ended; the fête is ended.
You can go down and tell them.
I've come back alone.
My fiancée will not come.
Scruples, fear, lack of faith . . . besides, sir, I must explain to you . . .'
But he could not go on. His face screwed up.
He explained nothing.
He suddenly turned away and went, in the dim light, to open and then close drawers full of clothes and books.
'I am going to get ready to go away again,' he said.
'Let no one disturb me.'
He placed various things on the table, a dressing, a revolver.. .
And Meaulnes walked out, full of dismay, not daring to say a word or to shake hands.
Downstairs everybody seemed to have guessed something already.
Nearly all the girls had changed dresses.
In the main building dinner had started, but people ate in haste, anyhow, as at the moment of starting on a journey.
There was a constant going to and fro from this large kitchen hall to the bedrooms and stables.
Those who had done eating formed groups and said 'Good-bye' to each other.
'What's happening?' asked Meaulnes of a peasant boy who was making haste to finish his meal, a felt hat on his head and a table napkin tucked into his waistcoat:
'We are leaving,' he said.
'It's been decided very suddenly.
At five o'clock we found ourselves quite alone, all the guests together.
We had waited as long as we possibly could.
Too late for the lovers to turn up.
Somebody said, "Let's go". . . And everybody made ready to leave.'
Meaulnes made no reply.
He did not mind going now.
Had he not reached the end of his adventure? . . . Had he not this once obtained all that he wished for?
Scarcely had he had time even quietly to go over in his mind the beautiful conversation of the morning.
At the moment the only thing was to go.
And soon he would come back - without trickery this time ...
'If you like to come with us,' went on his companion, who was a boy of his own age, 'look sharp and get ready; we are going to harness up at once.'
Meaulnes hurried out, leaving his meal unfinished and omitting to tell the guests what he knew.
The park, the garden, and the yard were now plunged in total darkness.
There were no lanterns that evening at the windows.
But as this dinner was, after all, not unlike the meal at the conclusion of a wedding, the less considerate of the guests, who had perhaps been drinking, began to sing.
As he went off, Meaulnes heard their cabaret songs fill the air of the park which for two days had held so much grace and so much wonder.
And it proved the beginning of confusion and chaos.
He passed close to the fish-pond into which he had looked, that very morning, at his own reflection.
How everything seemed changed already . . . with this song, sung in chorus, which reached him in snatches :
Where have you come from, little wanton?
Your cap is in two
Your hair all askew ...
And this one, too :
My shoes are red. . .
Good-bye, my lover . ..
My shoes are red. ..
Good-bye forever !
As he reached the foot of the stairs leading to his isolated lodging, some one came down and bumped into him in the dark, saying: 'Good-bye, sir!' - and wrapping himself in his cloak as if it were very cold, disappeared.
It was Frantz de Galais.
The candle which Frantz had left in his room was still burning.
Nothing had been touched.
Only, written on a conspicuous sheet of note-paper, were these words :
'My fiancée has disappeared, letting me know that she cannot be my wife; that she was a dressmaker and not a princess.
I do not know what will become of me.
I am going away.
I no longer wish to live.
May Yvonne forgive me for not saying good-bye to her, but she could not do anything for me . . .'
It was the end of the candle, the flame of which guttered, flickered a moment and went out.
Meaulnes returned to his own room and shut the door.
In spite of the darkness he made out all the things which he had tidied, in full daylight and in full happiness, a few hours before.
Garment after garment, all intact, he found again his old wretched suit, from his hobnailed shoes to his clumsy belt with the brass buckle.
He undressed and dressed again swiftly, but distraught, placing his borrowed clothes on a chair, putting on the wrong waistcoat, . .
Under the windows, in the stable-yard, the bustle of departure had begun.
Pulling, shouting, and pushing, each one wanted to get his vehicle out of the confused crowd in which it was hemmed.
From time to time a man would climb on the driver's seat of a trap or on the hood of a big covered cart and search about with his light.
The reflection of the lantern came in at the window; for a brief moment the room around Meaulnes, once familiar and where everything had been so friendly, breathed again, lived again . . . And thus it was that, carefully closing the door, he left this mysterious place which no doubt he was never again to see.
THE STRANGE FESTIVAL (concluded)
Already, night as it was, a string of vehicles wound slowly towards the gate at the entrance of the wood.
A man, in a goatskin, holding a lantern, led the first horse of the procession.
Meaulnes was anxious to find some one to give him a lift.
He was anxious to go away.
Deep within him he dreaded finding himself suddenly alone at the manor and his trick discovered.
When he arrived in front of the main building, he found the drivers assigning their occupants to the last carriages.
The travellers were made to stand while the seats were brought forward or pushed backward, and the girls, swathed in shawls, got up clumsily, the rugs slipping to their feet, and one could distinguish the anxious faces of those whose heads were lowered towards the carriage lights.
One of these drivers Meaulnes recognised as the young peasant who had offered to see him home a while ago.
'May I get in?' he called out.
'Where are you going, my lad!' replied the other, not recognising him.
'Sainte-Agathe way.'
'Then you should ask Maritain for a seat.'
And the big schoolboy started in search of this unknown Maritain amongst the guests who were late in leaving.
The man was pointed out to him amongst the convivial spirits in the kitchen.
'He's a slacker,' they told him; 'he'll be here till three in the morning.'
Meaulnes thought for a moment of the poor worried girl who, in the midst of her grief and anxiety, would hear the songs of these tipplers filling the place far into the night. In which room was she?
Where was her window amongst these mysterious buildings?
But there was no point in stopping.
He must go.
Once back at Sainte-Agathe everything would become clearer; he would no longer be a runaway schoolboy; he would once more be able to dream of the young mistress of the manor.
One by one the vehicles left; the wheels grated on the sand of the drive.
One could see them turn to disappear in the night with loads of muffled-up women and children wrapped in shawls and already dropping asleep.
One more big covered cart; then passed a wagonette in which women were huddled shoulder to shoulder, and Meaulnes was left standing bewildered on the steps of the house.
Soon, only an old berlin, driven by a peasant in a smock, would be left.
'You can get in,' he replied to Augustin's inquiries. 'We are going your way.'
With some difficulty Meaulnes opened the door of the rickety old vehicle, while the panes rattled and the hinges creaked.
On the seat, in a corner of the carriage two quite small children, a boy and a girl, were asleep.
The noise and the cold woke them. They stretched, looked vaguely about them shivering, nestled back in their corner and dropped off to sleep again.
Now the old carriage set off.
Meaulnes closed the door more gently, and carefully settled in the other corner; then, hungrily, he tried to make out, through the window, the place he was about to leave and the road by which he had come : he guessed, in spite of the darkness, that the carriage was crossing the courtyard and the garden, passing in front of the stairway leading to his room, going through the gate and leaving the manor grounds to enter the woods.
The trunks of the old fir trees could be distinguished moving by the window.
'Perhaps we shall meet Frantz de Galais,' Meaulnes said to himself with beating heart.
Suddenly, the carriage swerved in the narrow lane to avoid collision with an obstacle.
From its heavy appearance, as far as one could tell in the night, it was a caravan, almost in the middle of the road, which had stopped there during these last days in proximity to the fête.
Having passied that obstacle, the horses started again at a trot, and Meaulnes was beginning to tire of looking out of the window in a vain effort to pierce through the surrounding darkness, when suddenly, in the depths of the woods, there was a flash of light followed by a report.
The horses set off at full gallop and Meaulnes could not make out, at first, whether the peasant who drove was attempting to hold them back or on the contrary urging them on.
He wanted to open the door.
As the handle was on the outside, he tried without success to lower the window; he shook it. . . The children waking up in a fright huddled against each other without saying a word.
And while he shook the window, his face close to the glass, a bend in the road enabled him to see a white figure running.
It was the tall Pierrot of the fête, the bohemian in his fancy costume, but haggard and distracted and carrying in his arms a human body clasped closely to him.
Then all disappeared.
In the carriage, tearing on at full gallop in the night, the children were once more asleep.
No one to whom to speak of the mysterious happenings of the past two days.
After reviewing at length all he had seen and heard, the young man, himself tired, his heart heavy, dropped off to sleep like a sad child . . .
... It was scarcely dawn when the carriage stopped on the road and Meaulnes was awakened by some one knocking at the window.
With some difficulty the driver opened the door and shouted, while the icy wind froze the schoolboy to the bone: 'You get out here!
It's almost daylight.
We are going to take the short cut.
You're quite near Sainte-Agathe.'
Half asleep, Meaulnes obeyed, felt about in the darkest corner of the carriage for his cap which had rolled under the feet of the sleeping children; then he got out, stooping.
'Well, good-bye,' said the man, climbing back to his seat; 'you've only got six kilometres to do.
Look, there is the milestone by the roadside.'
Meaulnes, still heavy with sleep, dragged himself up to the milestone and sat down with his arms folded and his head bent forward as though to fall asleep again.
'No, no!' called out the coachman; 'you mustn't think of sleeping there.
It's too cold.
Come on, up you get, walk a bit. . .' ?
Staggering like a drunken man, the big boy with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders hunched up, went slowly along the road to Sainte-Agathe, while the old berlin, the last trace of the mysterious festival, quitted the highroad and jolted silently off over the grass track.
Now only the hat of the driver could be seen, dancing above the hedges . . .
'Second Part
THE GREAT GAME
Wind and cold, rain or snow, the impossibility of making any long expedition prevented Meaulnes and me from mentioning again the Lost Land before the end of the winter.
There was nothing worth beginning during these short February days - these Thursdays broken up by squalls which invariably ended, about five, in a dismal freezing downpour.
Nothing recalled Meaulnes' adventure except the strange fact that since the afternoon of his return we no longer had friends.
At recreation time the same games were got up as before, but Jasmin never spoke to Admiral Meaulnes.
In the evenings, as soon as the classroom was swept, the playground became deserted, as in the days when I was alone, and I now watched my friend strolling to and fro from the garden to the shed and from the playground to the dining-room.
On Thursday mornings each of us settled at the master's desk in one of the two classrooms to read Rousseau and Paul Louis Courrier whom we had dug out of the cupboards from amongst English textbooks and copybooks of carefully transcribed music.
In the afternoon some caller or other often caused us to leave the house and return to the school . . . Sometimes we used to hear some of the senior boys stop for a moment, as if by chance, in front of the big gate, bang against it during some unintelligible military games, and then go away. . . .
This melancholy life went on until the end of February. I was beginning to think that Meaulnes had forgotten everything when an adventure, stranger than the others, came to prove to me that I had been mistaken and that a violent storm was brewing under the dreary surface of this winter life.
It happened to be a Thursday evening towards the end of the month, that the first news of the mysterious manor, the first ripple of that adventure of which we never spoke, reached us.
We were all snug for the evening.
My grandparents having left, there remained only Millie and my father, who had not the least idea of the secret quarrel by which the form was split into two clans.
At eight o'clock Millie, who had opened the door to shake out the crumbs after the meal, exclaimed: Ah!' in a voice so clear that we all came near to look.
On the doorstep there was a layer of snow ... As it was very dark, I walked a few steps into the playground to see if the layer was thick.
I felt light flakes touch my face, to melt at once.
I was quickly made to come in, and Millie, feeling chilly, hastened to shut the door.
At nine o'clock we prepared to go to bed; Mother was already holding the lamp in her hand when we quite distinctly heard two violent bangs hammered with great fury against the big gate at the other end of the playground.
Millie put down the lamp on the table and we all stood there alert, listening.
No one dreamed of going to see what was the matter.
Before getting halfway across the playground the lamp would have been out and the glass broken.
There was a short silence and Father was beginning, Tt must have heen . . .' when right under the dining-room window looking on the Station Road, as I have said before, sounded a shrill prolonged whistle which must have been heard as far as the church.
And immediately behind the window, scarcely softened by the glass, and coming from people who seemed to have hoisted themselves up to the window-sill, burst loud shouts of: 'Fetch him along!
Fetch him along!'
At the other end of the building other loud shouts responded.
These people must have gone through Father Martin's field and climbed on the low wall separating the field from the playground.
Then cries of 'Fetch him along,' shouted on every side by eight or ten unknown persons disguising their voices, burst out from the roof of the larder which they could only reach by climbing over a heap of faggots leaning against the outside wall; from a little wall which tan from the shed to the big gate and on which being rounded you could sit comfortably astride; from the railed wall along the Station Road, quite easy to climb . . . Finally a number of stragglers came up from the garden behind, making the same din, but shouting: 'Let 'em have it!'
And we heard the sound of their yells echoing in the empty classrooms where they had opened the windows.
Meaulnes and I knew so well all the corners and corridors of the big building that we could clearly see, as on a plan, the positions from which the unknown people were launching their attack.
To tell the truth, it was only just at first that we were frightened.
The shrill whistle had made the four of us think of tramps and gipsies breaking in.
As a matter of fact, for the last fortnight, a tall rogue and a youngster with his head bandaged up had been about in the square behind the church.
There were strange workmen, too, at the wheelwright's and the blacksmith's.
But as soon as we heard the cries of the assailants we were convinced that we had to do with people - probably youngsters - from the village.
Absolute little scalawags - you could spot them by their piercing voices - were among the crowd who stormed our house as they would board a ship.
'Well, I never ...' exclaimed my father.
And Millie asked in a faint voice : 'What on earth does it all mean?'
Suddenly the voices near the big gate and the adjoining wall stopped, then those near the window.
Two blasts of a whistle came from behind the French window.
The cries of those hanging on the larder roof and of those attacking from the garden grew fainter and fainter, then ceased ; we heard along the dining- room wall the scuttering steps of the whole gang in hasty retreat, getting lost in the snow.
Some one obviously was disturbing them.
At an hour when all slept, they thought they could easily storm a house isolated at the far end of the village.
But here was some one upsetting their plan of campaign.
We had scarcely time to recover - for the attack had been sudden as a well-planned boarding of a ship - and prepared to sally out, when we heard a voice we knew call out at the same gate :
'Monsieur Seurel!
Monsieur Seurel!'
It was M. Pasquier, the butcher.
The fat little man scraped his clogs on the doorstep, shook his short smock powdered with snow, and came in.
He put on the knowing and startled air of one who has surprised the secret of a mystery.
'I was in my yard which faces the Cross-Roads.
I was going to lock up the goats' shed.
Suddenly, standing there in the snow, what d'ye think I saw? Two tall lads as looked posted like sentries or on the watch for something.
They were standing by the cross.
I went towards them, just two steps. - Lord ! there be these lads starting off at full-speed towards here.
I didn't wait; not me. I picked up my lantern and I said: I be off to tell M. Seurel of this . . .'
And once more he begins his story. 'I was in my yard at the back of my place . . .' So we offer him a drink, which he accepts, and we ask him details which he cannot give.
He had seen nothing on reaching our house.
All the bands, warned by the two sentries whom he had disturbed, had at once vanished.
As for knowing who the rascals could be . . .
'Gipsies, quite likely,' he suggested.
'For a month they've been about in the square waiting for fine weather to give us a play, and must have been hatching some mischief.'
This did not help us much, and we all stood there very puzzled while the man sipped his drink and once more started his story, when Meaulnes, who so far had listened attentively, took the butcher's lantern from the floor and exclaimed : 'We must go and see !'
He opened the door and we followed him, M. Seurel, M. Pasquier, and myself.
Millie, quite herself again after the attackers' departure, and, like all orderly and careful people, very uninquisitive by nature, said : 'Well, go if you like, but close the door and take the key.
As for me, I am going to bed; I'll leave the lamp burning.'
WE FALL INTO AN AMBUSH
We went out over the snow in absolute silence.
Meaulnes walked ahead, raying out the light from his storm lamp, like a fan. We had scarcely set foot outside the big gate when two figures in hoods sprang up like startled partridges from behind the town weighing-machine.
Either to cheek us, or from pleasure at the game they were up to there, or from nervousness and fear of being caught, they spoke a few words and laughed as they ran away.
Meaulnes dropped his lantern in the snow, calling out:
'Follow me, François ! . ..'
And leaving behind the two elderly men who could not stand the pace, we rushed in pursuit of the two shadows, who, after skirting the lower part of the village by the Old Plank Road, deliberately went back towards the church.
They ran steadily, without hurrying, and we kept up with them easily.
They crossed Church Street, where all was asleep and silent, and passed into a maze of by-streets and blind alleys at the back of the churchyard.
This was the quarter of the journeymen, sempstresses, and weavers known as 'The Nookery.'
We did not know it well and we had never been there at night.
The place was deserted in the daytime: the journeymen being away, the weavers working indoors ; and during this night of absolute silence it appeared even more forsaken, more asleep than other parts of the village.
So there was no possible chance of any one unexpectedly coming to lend us a hand.
I knew only one way amongst these small houses, scattered about at random like cardboard boxes, and that was the one leading to the dressmaker known as the 'Dumb Girl.'
You had to go down a rather steep slope paved here and there; then, taking two or three turns amongst weavers' back yards and empty stables, you came to a wide blind alley closed up by a farmyard long since deserted.
I used to visit the Dumb Girl with my mother, and while they talked on silently with flashing fingers and grunts common to people with her affliction, I could look out from the window at the high wall of the farm - the last house on that side of the village - and the closed gate of a disused yard destitute of straw, where nothing ever passed by . . .
That is exactly the way the two unknown persons took.
At each turning we feared to lose them, but, to my surprise, we always reached the corner of the next alley before they had left it.
I say to my surprise, because this could not possibly have been done, so short were these alleys, had they not slowed down whenever we were out of sight.
At last, without hesitating, they took the street leading to the Dumb Girl's, and I called out to Meaulnes: 'We've got them. It is a blind alley!'
The truth is, they had got us . . . They had led us exactly where they wanted.
When they reached the wall, they resolutely turned on us, and one of them let out that shrill whistle which we had already heard twice during the evening.
At once a dozen fellows came out of the abandoned farmyard where they had apparently been posted to await us.
They had pulled their hoods over their heads and hidden their faces in their scarves.
We knew beforehand who they were, but we had decided not to tell M. Seurel, as our affairs were not his concern.
There were Delouche, Denis, Giraudat, and all the others.
We recognised each one during the skirmish by his way of fighting and by snatches of talk.
But one worrying thing remained and seemed almost to frighten Meaulnes : some one was with them whom we did not know and who seemed to be their leader . . .
He never touched Meaulnes ; he watched the work of his men, who, being dragged in the snow and their clothes torn, had all they could do to tackle the great breathless chap.
A couple of them had gone for me, and had had a job to put me out, as I fought like a demon.
I was on the ground, knees bent, sitting on my heels; they twisted my arms behind my back, and I watched it all with intense curiosity mingled with terror.
Meaulnes shook off top-form boys by twisting violently round on himself and throwing them headlong into the snow... And the Unknown, standing very straight, followed the fight with interest, but perfect calm, saying now and again in a clear voice : 'Go on... Courage... Once more... Go on, my boys...'
Obviously he was in command . . . Where had he sprung from?
Where and how had he trained them for the fight?
This remained a mystery to us.
His face, like the others', was hidden in a scarf, but when Meaulnes shook off his adversaries and advanced towards him, the gesture the Unknown made to see clearly and face the position, exposed some white linen with which his head was swathed as in a bandage.
At this moment I cried out to Meaulnes : 'Look out behind 1 There's another.'
He had scarcely turned round when a lanky fellow, springing from the gate at Meaulnes' back, cleverly twisted a scarf around my friend's neck and threw him backward.
At once the four boys who had fallen in the snow came back to the fray to pin Meaulnes down, tying his arms with a cord, his legs with a scarf, while the young man with the bandaged head searched his pockets ... The late comer, the thrower of the lasso, had lit a small candle which he protected with his hand, and at each find of some new piece of paper the leader went to this light to examine what it contained.
